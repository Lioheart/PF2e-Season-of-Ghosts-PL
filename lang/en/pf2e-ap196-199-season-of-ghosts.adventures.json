Specifically, the bulk of this adventure path happens in and around the town of Willowshore, which is presented in further detail beginning @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sogho01player.JournalEntryPage.01willowshoreg00]{Here}.</p> <p>Of greater note is the time in which Season of Ghosts takes place—unlike other Adventure Paths, the events of Season of Ghosts take place roughly over the course of a year, starting on the first day of summer in the year 7108 ic (4608 ar in the Inner Sea region), over a hundred years in the past and only a few years after the start of the Age of Lost Omens.</p> </aside> <p>Welcome to the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path!</p> <p>This Player’s Guide will help you to prepare for a horror-themed campaign set in the rural regions of the nation of Shenmen, where your characters play the roles of hometown heroes who must rise to the occasion and defend the people of Willowshore from a sinister curse and all manner of supernatural threats—while also preparing for what might be a particularly cruel winter season. You’ll begin as 1st-level characters who, if you haven’t lived in Willowshore your whole lives, have come to be recognized and welcomed as locals after arriving in town in the recent past.</p> <p>This Adventure Path is split into four parts, each taking place during a different season as your PCs grow more powerful and the threats facing Willowshore grow deadlier and more shocking. The Adventure Path features some particularly significant plot twists and revelations, so if you’ve had some of these surprises revealed to you, please consider other players’ experiences before spoiling the secrets that await discovery during the later parts of Season of Ghosts!</p> <p>To play in this campaign, all you need is the Pathfinder Core Rulebook and a character sheet. With your Game Master’s permission, you can also use Pathfinder Second Edition supplemental rulebooks, campaign setting books, and other accessories to further customize your character, especially since this campaign is set on the continent of Tian Xia, where the most common ancestries, faiths, and other elements aren’t the same as those assumed in a campaign set in the Inner Sea region.</p> <p>On the following pages, you’ll find specific suggestions to help you create a new character for Season of Ghosts.

While the cause of this increased haunting is uncertain, these ghosts often lure people to their deaths.</p> <p>In Willowshore, a massive feast and festival takes place on the last day of spring. Called the “Reenactment Festival,” this gala is meant not only to celebrate the end of spring, but to trick the evil spirits and ghosts believed to come out of the woods during the first few weeks of summer. As the festival’s feast concludes, the town reenacts victims being snatched away by “ghosts” (played by townsfolk in paper masks). Those not involved in the faux abduction pretend to plunge into collective panic as designated wailers mourn loudly while others play out a search and rescue effort. This farce is believed to trick real ghosts into thinking that someone has already haunted the settlement, and thus trick them into seeking a happier village to inflict misery upon once the season of ghosts begins the next day on the first day of summer.</p> <p>As fate would have it, the PCs are chosen this year to play the role of the town’s abductees—reasons for their abduction are built in to the various Season of Ghosts backgrounds, so if you don’t use one of these backgrounds for your character, work with the GM to create a reason similar to those presented there to explain why you’re among the festival’s abductees.</p> <p>Once you’re “abducted” from the feast, your captors roll you up in straw mats and then carry you off into a forest clearing on the town’s outskirts, where you’re expected to stay overnight. With the first dawn of summer, the “abductees” are ransomed by whoever is in charge of that year’s Reenactment Festival. This year, that honor falls to one Choe Chun-hu, beloved leader of Willowshore’s millers. He has promised to bring the “ransom” (a selection of delicious breakfast delicacies) to the PCs in the forest clearing the next morning for them to enjoy before leading them back to town to proclaim the Reenactment Festival a grand success.</p> <p>While it often rains during the summer, you luck out and spend a relatively comfortable night out under the stars. Of course, staying overnight in any woodland carries some risk, and you all have plenty of time to prepare. You can bring all your starting items and gear, as determined during character creation, to have with you during your abduction—items not brought will be waiting for you back at home.</p> <p>The Season of Ghosts Adventure Path begins when you and the other PCs awaken in a forest clearing on the first day of summer... but there’s no sign of Choe Chun-hu and the breakfast he promised! </p>"

While playing a campaign this far in the past could result in significant work to revise the setting in various parts of Golarion, Season of Ghosts requires very little work in this regard, as Willowshore is a remote rural location that, for the first several years of the Age of Lost Omens, was largely ignored and left to its own devices.</p> <p>The Age of Lost Omens began in 7106, during which powerful storms wracked much of Golarion. Willowshore was no exception, and the winter storms that blasted the region were among the worst in memory. Now, two years later, the people of Willowshore are somewhat nervous about the coming winter season. Even though the winter of 7107 was relatively mild, memories of the snow, high winds, and torrential rains of 7106 linger.</p> <p>The collapse of the empire of Lung Wa is a less immediate concern to Willowshore, even though on a larger regional scale, this political upheaval would be one of the most important events to shape modern Tian Xia. While Shenmen’s rule under Lung Wa ends in 7106, the fact that small towns like Willowshore had traditionally been largely ignored and left to their own devices under governors installed by Lung Wa edicts has largely sheltered Willowshore from ramifications, even two years after the empire’s collapse. Willowshore is fortunate that the governor assigned by the empire, a man named Heh Shan-Bao, is relatively benign as far as tradition goes, and if anything, the lack of a yearly tax collector or other imperial visitors have resulted in idyllic seasons in the rural town. Meanwhile, the mayhem of a collapsed empire has led to violence and upheaval in more urban areas. The largest change that hit Willowshore as the result of Lung Wa’s collapse was the abandonment of the town by various lumber lords, who left their estates and lumber camps rather than continue to supply the demands of the city of Sze, the closest large settlement to Willowshore. For the people of Willowshore, the loss of these unpleasant long-term visitors was seen almost universally as a relief, and their manors and lumber camps have been left alone—in part out of fear that they could return at any time, but mostly because of a local belief that letting these buildings and locations be reclaimed by the woods is the most respectful way to usher Lung Wa’s influence over Willowshore into memory.</p> <p>The notion that jorogumo have taken control of Shenmen remains, at this point, “ghost story” or “scary rumor.” No jorogumo has visited Willowshore yet... at least, as far as anyone knows. Likewise, news that the ruler of the city of Sze has died and returned as a ghost has reached town, yet not everyone believes these stories. The people of Willowshore are content to live as they always have... for now!</p> <aside> <h1 class=\"no-toc\">About Shenmen</h1> <p>While some nations in Tian Xia are inspired by certain real-life cultures, Shenmen is primarily inspired by horror traditions taken from a wide range of real-world stories. It’s a fictional nation and isn’t meant to represent more than these traditions of supernatural horror. During this nation’s history, it was conquered by Lung Wa, picked up immigrants from Hwanggot, and was taken over by jorogumo. It has a mix of cultures as a result, and its people have adopted words from multiple languages for their names and places. In Shenmen, ghosts and monsters are a very real part of life, and the practices employed by its people arise from necessity, not superstition.</p> <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Horror and Consent</h1> <p>Season of Ghosts is a horror-themed campaign, and as such, the GM and players should work together to ensure that the themes present as this Adventure Path unfolds will be appropriate for the game table. If you aren’t comfortable with certain tropes or themes common to the horror genre, speak with your GM and the other players before beginning Season of Ghosts to arrive at a common ground where everyone at your table can enjoy the campaign equally.</p> </aside>"

Tieflings are often regarded with fear and suspicion by those in Willowshore, but any PCs of such an ancestry in Season of Ghosts is already known to the other townsfolk as an “exception” to the expectation—speak to your GM about integrating such a character into this campaign in the event that they wish to adjust certain aspects of the campaign to reflect your choice.</p> <p><strong><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Character Guide</em> Ancestries:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.piNLXUrm9iaGqD2i]{Hobgoblin} PCs might have come to Willowshore from the western nation of Kaoling, but like tieflings, hobgoblins are often regarded with fear or suspicion. @Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.cdhgByGG1WtuaK73]{Leshies} are more generally welcome, and indeed, a small group of them maintain a saloon of sorts in Willowshore.</p> <p><strong><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em> Ancestries:</strong> Many more ancestries common to Tian Xia will be introduced in the Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide, due for publication in 2024—if you wish to play any of these ancestries once these options become available, speak with your GM.</p>"

While Willowshore only has a population of 225 (excluding your PCs!), the town’s history and placement make it open toward a wide range of potential character classes to be represented by its newest cast of heroes. </p> <p><strong>Alchemists</strong> are respected and adored in Willowshore, both for their skill as herbalists and talent in crafting fanciful distractions for festivals. Local herbalist You So-Jin of Graveside Manners focuses more on the herbalism side of alchemical innovation, but access to her alchemist’s lab and supplies, should you earn her support and friendship, will be of great use. The chirurgeon research field is the most appropriate thematic choice for a Willowshore alchemist, but any research field will be of equal use in Season of Ghosts.</p> <p><strong>Barbarians</strong> might be a complex choice for Season of Ghosts, considering the lack of any established barbarian clans in the region. Though there are no barbarian NPCs in Willowshore, there are plenty of locals who enjoy a good fight or appreciate physical strength. An animal instinct barbarian might be valued for their skills at hunting, while a spirit instinct barbarian might find themselves respected as a defender against the evil spirits that locals fear (and will certainly find their ability to harm incorporeal foes more easily to be a great boon during many combat encounters in Season of Ghosts!) Other instincts don’t have a particular thematic tie to Willowshore, but none of them are particularly poor choices overall for this Adventure Path.</p> <p><strong>Bards</strong> will have many opportunities to influence NPCs, craft singular performances, or use music to their advantage at various points during Season of Ghosts, but no specific build is more advantageous over another in this Adventure Path. If you select enigma as your muse, Tan Sui-Jing (an ancient folk hero whose accomplishments in the past are now a part of Willowshore’s legacy) or Great Willow (the strange kodama kami associated with the towering willow tree of the same name that looms atop a hill north of town) might be fun choices—speak with your GM to find out if any other mysterious muses might make sense. In Willowshore, Kazuma Oono, the director who runs the Seven-Colored Songbird theater, is known to periodically audition performers.</p> <p><strong>Champions</strong> are all appropriate for Season of Ghosts, provided their tenets don’t set them up to clash against the rest of the party. The classic example of the ronin who settled in a small town to become their defender is an iconic role for a champion in a campaign like Season of Ghosts. While there aren’t many encounters in this Adventure Path that require the PCs to be mounted, there will be plenty of opportunities in both urban and wilderness areas where having a mount in combat could be helpful.</p> <p><strong>Clerics</strong> should consider the additional information presented under Faiths (page 8) for guidelines on which deity to worship.</p> <p><strong>Druids</strong> will have ample opportunity to excel in Season of Ghosts as a result of the Adventure Path’s focus on a year’s worth of seasons and the town of Willowshore being a rural location. Temperate forests are the primary natural terrain featured in this Adventure Path. The druid orders of animal, leaf, and storm are the most thematically appropriate choices for this Adventure Path, but all orders will find opportunities in this campaign. The following animals are the most common in the region surrounding Willowshore, so choosing one of them as your animal companion will also be on theme (if you wish to choose a different animal companion, speak to your GM about how this animal might have become your companion under unusual circumstances): arboreal sapling, badger, bat, bear, beetle, bird, boar, cat,horse, snake, or wolf.</p> <p><strong>Fighters</strong> will find ample opportunity to shine in Season of Ghosts, but it’s important to remember that there are a lot of urban and downtime elements in this Adventure Path. Consider bolstering your training in a skill like Crafting, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Society so that during the noncombat portions of this Adventure Path, you’ll still have moments to shine.</p> <p><strong>Gunslingers</strong> aren’t a particularly good choice, thematically, for this Adventure Path, and beyond that, there are no resources for gunslingers to rely upon in the town of Willowshore. If you want to play a gunslinger, talk to your GM first, but it’s probably best to save ideas for a gunslinger PC for another campaign.</p> <p><strong>Inventors</strong> aren’t common in Shenmen, but they’re hardly unknown, and their knack for rigging up contraptions and creative solutions can be quite valuable in a rural area like Willowshore where access to a wider range of rare or specialized tools and gear aren’t guaranteed. Indeed, Huo Tian-Zhe of Willowshore’s smithy Second Best is well-known for his contraptions and creations, and he could make for an excellent ally or friend to a PC inventor. There’s no inventor innovation that’s more or less appropriate for Season of Ghosts than another.</p> <p><strong>Investigators</strong> will find plenty of opportunities to research information, track clues, and unravel mysteries during the course of Season of Ghosts, making them a particularly excellent thematic choice for this Adventure Path overall. The methodologies of alchemical sciences and forensic medicine are the most thematically appropriate options for this Adventure Path.</p> <p><strong>Kineticists</strong> are a fine choice for Season of Ghosts, although there isn’t much thematic support in Willowshore for an elemental or kineticist flavor—if you wish to play a kineticist, speak with your GM about potentially adjusting that in some way. In particular, a theme of “wood against metal” plays a subtle underlying theme in this campaign; the people of Willowshore more align to the themes of wood, while the themes of metal more align with some elements of the campaign’s opposition.</p> <p><strong>Magi</strong> will find their abilities useful throughout Season of Ghosts but aren’t particularly tied, thematically, to this Adventure Path’s plot. Of course, that also means a magus character will be relatively free from thematic clashes when making choices about their increasing power!</p> <p><strong>Monks</strong> are a strong thematic choice for Willowshore, a town that was originally founded to serve as support for a remote monastery. While that monastery, the Tan Sugi Monastery, is now in ruins and no longer operational, there are plenty of places that a monk’s lifestyle can be rewarding in Willowshore proper, if only as part of the town’s rich history and legacy. See Faith below for additional guidance on religion or belief.</p> <p><strong>Oracles</strong> are perhaps an even stronger thematic choice for Season of Ghosts than clerics as far as divine spellcasters are concerned. Most oracle mysteries are strong thematic choices in this Adventure Path with Battle, Cosmos, and Flames being the least so. Also, see Faith below for additional guidance on religions.</p> <p><strong>Psychics</strong> aren’t represented among Willowshore’s citizens, but their magical practices are known and admired. Those who focus their studies and powers on themes associated with lore, discovering ancient secrets, or battling supernatural forces will find themselves with no shortage of opportunity in Season of Ghosts.</p> <p><strong>Rangers</strong> are quite valued among Willowshore’s people; their survivalist abilities and hunting acumen allow the town to maintain its self-sufficiency. The town’s Silvermist Lodges are the traditional locations where local rangers would gather, but today, a ranger could be based out of nearly any location in town or the hinterlands beyond. If you gain an animal companion, consult the suggestions above for druids. If you take the Favored Terrain feat, the terrain of Forest is far and above the most common terrain you’ll face during Season of Ghosts. Aquatic (in the form of lakes and rivers) and Mountain terrain have much more minor roles to play, after which there are even lesser roles for Plains, Sky, Swamp, and Underground. Season of Ghosts doesn’t feature arctic or desert terrain.</p> <p><strong>Rogues</strong> will find many uses for their skills in Season of Ghosts, particularly when it comes to those associated with navigating the politics of a small rural town. Consider the advice for skills later in this Player’s Guide when choosing where to focus your training.</p> <p><strong>Sorcerers</strong> are an excellent thematic choice for this Adventure Path, as Willowshore is steeped in many supernatural and mysterious traditions. All sorcerer bloodlines could be equally interesting in Season of Ghosts, but the most thematically appropriate ones are imperial, psychopomp, or undead.</p> <p><strong>Summoners</strong> should consider the regions surrounding Willowshore (forests, with some low mountains and plenty of rivers and lakes) when building their eidolon, but apart from that, they’ll find they have a wide range of choices during Season of Ghosts. The most thematic choices for eidolons in this Adventure Path are anger phantom, beast, devotion phantom, plant, or psychopomp.</p> <p><strong>Swashbucklers</strong> are like fighters in that they’ll find plenty of chances to show their stuff in this campaign’s battles, but they should consider an option to explore during downtime or while in urban areas when fighting isn’t the best solution.</p> <p><strong>Thaumaturges</strong> are excellent choices for Season of Ghosts, for like the investigator, they’ll be faced with a wide range of mysteries and ancient secrets to explore and uncover. All thaumaturge implements could find thematic links to build from in this campaign, but perhaps none more so than the lantern, considering Willowshore’s strong tradition with its Eternal Lantern (page 18). While you can’t select this particular lantern as your implement, a lantern crafted in its image would fit right in!</p> <p><strong>Witches</strong> are perhaps an even more thematically appropriate choice for a spellcaster than sorcerer for Season of Ghosts, due to their ties with a mysterious patron and their horror-adjacent themes built right into the class. Speak with your GM when choosing your patron for additional guidance, but the patron themes of curse, night, wild, and winter are always going to be excellent choices in this Adventure Path. When choosing a familiar, keep in mind that Willowshore is associated with a traditional guardian along its eastern edge in the form of a large stone spider in a shrine just off the road—as such, choosing a spider familiar is quite on theme!</p> <p><strong>Wizards</strong> will find their mastery over magic to be something the people of Willowshore quite value—provided their focus isn’t on something unsettling and frightening! That said, all schools of magic will have ample opportunities for use during this Adventure Path. A PC wizard might wish to pursue an alliance or friendship with Igawa Jubei of Mother’s Coil, Willowshore’s resident wizard and scholar of all things magical.</p>"

Some of these shrines, like those devoted to Daikitsu and Pharasma, are in well-known locations, but many are private shrines or shrines that have been all but forgotten. </p> <p>Shrines to the following deities are found in Willowshore; if your character worships one of these deities, then they’ll automatically know the location of that shrine: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.d56paSkcwvll2OhR]{Abadar}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.AlL9GtlTldbqNoVm]{Calistria}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.M3eb94Nd6uXti2IK]{Daikitsu}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.wjXNXFWBLbJaeZQR]{Ketephys}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.AIcDyoff265z9285]{Kofusachi}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.r6SFB1PzKsagDXff]{Lady Nanbyo}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.MbJ93Nw39h2cBYi5]{Lao Shu Po}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.gsFaxWHbZmc1moY6]{Nalinivati}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.giAsBYiL2omr0x2L]{Qi Zhong}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.gxwmzxUWBOhdgFSN]{Shelyn}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.s9opv94lGDRKnw6W]{Shizuru}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aTYy1WHwAZiuei4h]{Tsukiyo}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.83jKKHQPoqVylmrF]{Yaezhing}. If you choose to worship a deity beyond those listed here, speak with your GM—your faith might even result in another shrine being added to Willowshore’s list!</p> <p>Note that certain faiths, such as those of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.HtRxo4J3elFteIqu]{Arazni}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.soiVh53y9RAeSLEk]{Casandalee}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.jL1qiVOZBKXETtVD]{Nocticula}, either don’t yet exist or haven’t yet undergone the significant changes they made in the hundred or so years after the start of the Age of Lost Omens. Likewise, while Aroden’s death is only a few years in the past, his faith isn’t significant in Tian Xia—and certainly not in Willowshore. Your character should avoid worshipping such deities as a result of this Adventure Path’s timeline.</p> <p>Beyond the town’s wide range of deities, many in Willowshore are followers of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.WfqLY2Fm1LGCcG5X]{Sangpotshi}. Indeed, the original founders of the town were adherents to this belief. They built the Tan Sugi Monastery up in the hills to the west as a remote place to pursue enlightenment through this philosophy, and they founded Willowshore to first support those who toiled to build the monastery, and later as a trade hub to support the monks. The Tan Sugi Monastery is now abandoned and has been left to ruin (and, some maintain, to various ghosts and monsters), but many in Willowshore still follow the path of Sangpotshi.</p>"

This Adventure Path spans an entire year, after all, and now and then, you’ll be spending weeks at a time pursuing various downtime activities. Skills that feature often in combat encounters (or immediately following), such as Acrobatics, Athletics, Medicine, and Stealth, will be consistently useful throughout the campaign, with some of them (particularly Athletics) having significant other applications during various downtime pursuits.</p> <p>Of the four skills associated with magical traditions, Nature and Religion will have significant opportunities to shine throughout the entire Adventure Path. Arcana comes into its own more in the second half of this four-part campaign, as does Occultism.</p> <p>Skills that help with social interaction, such as Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Society, will see constant use throughout Season of Ghosts. Deception will often be useful in encounter mode, of course, to Create a Diversion or Feint, but its chances to shine outside of combat are minimal (if important) during the first half of the campaign—in the second half, skill at Deception becomes much more important.</p> <p>Being able to subsist and be self-sufficient, or helping the remote town of Willowshore with the same goals, makes Survival an important skill throughout the campaign. Thievery will likewise be of great use, both in dealing with hazards but also periodically for certain downtime activities or challenges that might require more subtlety.</p> <p>Crafting becomes an important skill as well after the first adventure concludes, where you’ll increasingly be called upon during downtime events and activities to build, repair, or otherwise use this skill. While opportunities to use Performance to accomplish goals will be less common, each adventure will have a few moments where skill in this area can solve problems with ease.</p> <p>An extensive number of Lore skills are helpful in this campaign. Often when a downtime activity becomes available, a specific Lore skill will have a lower DC than something more generalized skills like Deception or Society. The most important Lore skill in this Adventure Path is Willowshore Lore, as one would expect of a campaign set almost entirely within and around this small town! Other important Lore skills that will have more than a couple opportunities to shine in the campaign include Academia, Art, Engineering, Farming, Hunting, Library, Sangpotshi, and Tea Lore. Lore skills that will have only one or two chances to shine include any to do with non-tea food or drink, Architecture, Cooking, Fishing, Fortune-Telling, Games, Genealogy, Guild, Herbalism, Jorogumo, Labor, Mercantile, Midwifery, Qi-Zhong, River, Sailing, Scouting, Theater, Underworld, and Warfare Lore.</p> <p>One new lore skill worthy of note that isn’t represented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> but will become increasingly useful in this campaign is one associated with a specific family of new monster introduced in Season of Ghosts. Once your group discovers this new type of monster, becoming trained in its lore will help you prepare for combat against them or otherwise research plot elements to come, but not having any particular training in this specific Lore skill when you begin Season of Ghosts is not only fine, but part of the unfolding plot of the campaign. It’s mentioned here merely to prepare you for future opportunities for those players who enjoy building their character’s level choices out beforehand.</p> <p>You should avoid feats that work best in large cities or that rely upon long-distance travel beyond what you could do in a few days, as these elements don’t play a role in Season of Ghosts. Feats that help you to interact with other townsfolk, bolster your ability to be self-sufficient, or would generally prove useful to anyone living out a year of their life in a remote woodland town will be more useful than normal.</p>"

There are plenty of mysterious events and haunting legends about Willowshore or its hinterlands, and as a result of your upbringing, you’ve become particularly interested in learning more about them. While much of the regional folklore comes from one of Willowshore’s many religions and local faiths (of which you might be a practicing member or perhaps instead have a secular interest in the lore), you’ve noticed that these beliefs also influence artisans and crafters in ways they might not even realize. You’re convinced that many of these local beliefs have roots in a deeper, historical event of great significance and hope one day to learn more about Willowshore’s true history.</p> <p class=\"no-indent\">If you’re religious, your home is likely near a shrine associated with your faith—if your faith isn’t represented among Willowshore’s shrines, speak with your GM about potentially having a shrine to your faith in or near to your home.</p> <p class=\"no-indent\">During the Reenactment Festival, you likely spent time chatting with others about ghost stories and sharing spooky legends and tales.

In particular, let your GM know if you’re comfortable potentially having family members become threatened by elements in Season of Ghosts, and make sure the other players are okay with this element as well. Again, there are no plot elements in Season of Ghosts that directly imperil any PC’s family (beyond the existential peril facing all of Willowshore’s inhabitants), but for some players and groups, involving family in stories like this one can make the experience more challenging and rewarding.</p> </aside> <p>You can add one of the following two adjustments to any background to further modify your choice to match your vision for your PC.</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> You and one (or more) other PCs are close family members (siblings, parent/child, married, etc.) If you take this adjustment, the other PC(s) who are your family must also take this adjustment.

Built around an ancient sugi tree said to have mystic properties, the Tan Sugi Monastery was incredibly remote, nestled in a wooded valley within an unsettled reach of Specterwood. Willowshore was originally founded to support those who built the monastery, and the long trail that connected the town to the monastery became known as the Pilgrim’s Path. Once construction of the monastery ended, Willowshore’s focus shifted to an increasingly self-sufficient lifestyle that only periodically needed to support the monks.</p> <p>Zhi Hui passed away in 7054, and as the monks of the monastery began to drift away, Willowshore itself shifted focus to the lumber industry. By 7060, the monastery had been abandoned, but when a group of woodcutters attempted to harvest the ancient sugi trees that grew there in 7062, tragedy struck. The woodcutters returned to Willowshore with broken weapons and unliving bodies that evening, and while these undead woodcutters were defeated by morning, dozens of townsfolk had perished during the struggle. The event is remembered today as the “Night of Broken Blades,” and few visitors have made the journey to the ruined monastery in the 46 years since. The place is regarded now as cursed, haunted, or worse.</p> <p>As the years wore on, Shenmen officially enlisted Willowshore to become part of Lung Wa’s lumber harvesting ambitions. Things started out well, with the construction of infrastructure including bridges and a dam. However, the lumber bosses who ran the harvesting operation soon became loathed for their exploitation of Willowshore’s ascetic past. Worse, they began to present the settlement (now properly called a town) as a “getaway” for Lung Wa aristocrats to hunt for sport and indulge in food and drinks forcefully seized in the empire’s name.</p> <p>When Lung Wa collapsed in 7106, Willowshore’s lumber lords took their wealth, abandoned their estates, and fled. Most of the soldiers stationed in town returned to Shenmen’s capital or deserted their posts, leaving behind those who had put down local roots. Willowshore’s remoteness saved it from rampant banditry and external political conflicts that had begun to plague Shenmen, but as you will soon discover when you begin to play Season of Ghosts, the time has come for Willowshore to face the new world.</p>"

The first wave of townspeople were either those who worked on the monastery or were paid to settle in Willowshore by the monastery. These folks originally lived south of the river and are thus referred to as Southbankers. Those who arrived after Lung Wa took control, meanwhile, settled on the river’s northern banks, called Northridge due to its prominent incline. These settlers included workers for the lumber bosses, businesses that wanted convenient access to the lumber, and imperial guards. </p> <p> Though these two factions in Willowshore today use the names Southbank and Northridge, one’s allegiance isn’t solely determined by where they live or work. Southbank residents are traditionalists, keen on maintaining Willowshore’s culture and living simply off the land. Northridge residents, meanwhile, focus on pragmatism and urban growth. Many in Northridge are open to the idea of jorogumo ruling Shenmen, while Southbankers on principle think jorogumo are evil monsters and best avoided. </p> <p> Despite disagreements, both sides have a consensus on putting Willowshore’s survival and safety first.

They didn’t officially join Willowshore until the expansion of the settlement made it inevitable. With allied families keeping the greedy lumber lords away, the leshies built their own tea farm business, taking to the roads with brewed tea and teaware stashed in rectangular bamboo backpacks. Some would shout slogans, while others used a simple temple block to inform customers of their arrival. These traveling merchants soon became an attraction and staple of Willowshore life. Ever since the Cerulean Teahouse closed, <strong>Mountain Summit Grass</strong> (agender leshy teamaker), the leader of this band of leshies, has been increasingly focusing on creating bespoke blends of tea for individual local customers they favor.</p> <p><strong>Wares:</strong> clay pottery tea ware, tea leaves</p>"

Grievous crimes were punished with exile unless the individual’s skill or knowledge was needed—the punishment was then permanent imprisonment. Executions were rare, as being exiled into Specterwood was often a death sentence in itself.</p> <p>Particularly vile criminals had a Mark of Crime tattooed onto their scalp, and after death, this tattoo was transferred to the bones through carving, meaning even in death and decomposition, the mark remained. Bodies with a Mark of Crime—be it from Willowshore, another village, or Lung Wa—can only be buried in this overgrown and unkept area.</p> <p>While graves were unmarked in the past, a few wooden posts have been erected recently and paper shuriken hung off them, seemingly in silent protest that the ones buried beneath might have died an unjust death. Or perhaps this is an attempt to stave off the rise of a bitter, vengeful ghost.</p>"

The Great Willow</h3> <p>Willowshore rests at the foot of a mountainous region known geographically as the Trimountains, named due to the three major peaks in the area. In her memoir, Master Zhi Hui noted how she found an ancient willow tree of unusual size at the summit of the lowest of these mountains. After befriending the kodama kami who protected the tree, Master Zhi Hui learned vital information that eventually led her to the Tan Sugi grove to the west. For this knowledge, the kodama of the so-called “Great Willow” has received much reverence from both Willowshore and visiting pilgrims over the years.</p> <p><strong>Wares:</strong> foraged foods and nonmetallic raw materials</p>"

Spider Gate</h3> <p>After the Night of Broken Blades, Willowshore’s governor caved to the demand for a new lantern at the entrance of the town to augment the protection afforded by the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> at the town’s heart. While the original plan was for the carpenters of Willowshore to build a tori gate or Tian-shu gateway on which lanterns could be hung, a Lung Wa aristocrat offered a free stone guardian spider from his garden since it no longer fit in with the garden’s decorations.</p> <p>Most Willowshorers thought the giant statue was the ugliest thing they’d ever seen. Nevertheless, they assumed the statue housed a guardian spirit and respected it accordingly. In time, villagers accepted their unique entrance guardian, even adopting it as their mascot and naming it “Ugly Cute.” The lantern Ugly Cute holds in its fangs is a regular lantern, unlike the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> found at Dawnstep Bridge, but the people of Willowshore value it just as much and strive to keep it lit at all times.</p>"

Where this river meets the sea stands Willowshore’s closest neighbor, the coastal fortified market called Karahai, yet even this location is a day’s ride from town.</p> <p>The immediate hinterlands feature a number of minor sites of interest. The <strong>Duyue River</strong> is the largest waterway in the region with Willowshore founded on one of its tributaries, the <strong>Ceiba River</strong>. A shallower tributary, Dragonfly Creek, winds south to an open area of rugged stone known as the <strong>Gorge of Fangs and Teeth</strong>—a natural quarry that supplied the stone for Willowshore’s roads and foundations. <strong>Gourd Lake</strong>, downriver from Willowshore, provides excellent fishing, but those who would ply its waters would do well to make offerings to the kappas who dwell in its depths and cavort on its southern shores. <strong>Green Silk Peak</strong>, nearly 2,000 feet high, is the highest point of elevation in the hinterlands, while the natural sinkholes known as the <strong>Eyes of Fumeiyoshi</strong> are the opposite—barren pits in the ground where nothing grows and gritty water has pooled. </p> <p>Signs of habitation beyond Willowshore are sparse in the region, but they do exist and are largely abandoned. To the northeast stand the burnt-out ruins of an abandoned roadhouse once known as <strong>Canary Inn</strong>, while a remote <strong>Hunter’s Hut</strong> stands near the headwaters of the Duyue River. To the north can be found an old expansion once intended to support Willowshore, but these buildings and farms were soon abandoned when it became apparent the stream that flowed through the area tended to dry up at random intervals each year. To the west, near the source of the Ceiba River, are the remains of the old <strong>Lumber Camp</strong> abandoned a few years ago by the local lumber lords—a location that’s slowly being reclaimed by the forest. And in the low mountains northwest of town, at the far end of the trail known as <strong>Pilgrim’s Path</strong>, stand the ruins of the <strong>Tan Sugi Monastery</strong>—a place reputed today to be the den of monsters, ghosts, or worse. </p> <p>The forest surrounding Willowshore is part of the much larger woodland known as Specterwood, although here in Willowshore’s hinterlands, the haunts and ghosts notorious for plaguing these woods aren’t as dangerous. Wildlife is abundant with deer and boars making up the primary large game in the region, and more dangerous predators like black bears, wolves, giant stag beetles, and enormous spiders comprise the greater perils of the hinterlands to those who travel too far from the roads or explore the wilds after dark.</p>"

When events might send you beyond the Willowshore hinterlands, your GM will have the information you need, but it’s easiest to focus on Willowshore and its hinterlands when seeking inspiration to create your character.</p> <p>Brief notes about what lies beyond the hinterlands down the six roads and trails that lead off the map are summarized below.</p> <p><strong>Central Northern Road:</strong> This partially ruined road winds through several fields that have gone fallow amid the ruins of a village that was abandoned many years ago, then eventually comes to an end at a large wetland known as Moon Marsh for the way the orange, night-blooming flowers that grow there shine under the moonlight.</p> <p><strong>Eastern Northern Road:</strong> This road connects Willowshore with numerous small but distant villages and towns scattered throughout Specterwood and eventually finds its way to the Gossamer Mountains. The next closest settlement down this road is Foxhollow, but it’s three days’ travel and even smaller than Willowshore.</p> <p><strong>Eastern Road:</strong> This road leads to the trade fortress of Karahai and represents Willowshore’s major economic link to the rest of Shenmen. Karahai has a small village (quite a bit smaller than Willowshore) nearby—the trade fortress itself being one of many economic hubs along the west coast of the Sea of Ghosts.</p> <p><strong>Northeastern Road:</strong> This road leads to a recently established farmstead on a bluff overlooking the Sea of Ghosts, a cattle ranch owned by a notoriously ruthless expatriate politician from the city of Sze who doesn’t have much to do with Willowshore.</p> <p><strong>Northwest Trail:</strong> This old overgrown trail leads off into the forest; most folks believe it leads to a long-abandoned shrine, but few travel this remote path today.</p> <p><strong>Southern Road:</strong> The southern road is a long overland route that eventually connects to better maintained roads and more populous villages and towns several days’ travel to the south, but most in Willowshore call it the “Apple Road,” as it leads to a grove of wild apple trees that produce particularly delicious fruit every fall.</p>"
