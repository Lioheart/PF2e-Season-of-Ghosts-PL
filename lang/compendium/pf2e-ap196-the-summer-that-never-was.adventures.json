A slain PC can even become undead (see Pathfinder Book of the Dead for options), though the townsfolk are unlikely to welcome such a sinister development. Also, a player can always create a new character to take the place of a fallen character. This new PC might be from Willowshore, or could be an adventurer who stumbled into the region back in 7108 and who arrives in Willowshore with a strange gap in their memory between the first day of summer and the current date in your campaign—a gap whose meaning will eventually become clear once the PCs realize what has happened to them! Once you reach the final adventure in this campaign, the PCs will have “caught up” to the current date, and introducing replacement characters as needed becomes less complex. </p> </aside> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Chapter 1: To Light the Night</span> </h2> <p> The PCs wake in the forest, but they soon discover their hometown has been engulfed in eerie supernatural weather and invaded by monsters. After making their way back into town and consulting with elders, the PCs pursue several missions to scout out the situation and take steps to relight the Eternal Lantern in the middle of Willowshore, which should drive back the supernatural weather and, hopefully, restore peace to the town! </p> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Chapter 2: Reclaiming Willowshore</span> </h2> <p> The PCs turn their attention to downtown Willowshore, where monsters have entrenched their position. Here, many townsfolk need rescue, and just as many strange and sinister creatures must be confronted before the town can be safely inhabited once again. </p> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Chapter 3: The Willowshore Curse</span> </h2> <p> The PCs discover that a cursed fog bank enshrouds the hinterlands, preventing all attempts to travel too far from town. Forced to rely upon what they have at hand, the PCs help the townsfolk of Willowshore recover from the monstrous invasion while investigating what could be the source of the strange curse that has trapped them in the region. </p> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Chapter 4: The Wall of Ghosts</span> </h2> <p> The PCs head west to confront the source of the curse. They then discover that the band of faceless monsters that now dwell in an abandoned lumber camp are merely worshippers of an older, more sinister force. This entity’s influence might be the actual source of the Willowshore curse—yet that lies beyond an impenetrable Wall of Ghosts. </p> <section class=\"advancement-track\"> <h1>Advancement Track</h1> <p>“The Summer That Never Was” is designed for four characters.</p> <p> <span class=\"level\">1</span> The PCs begin this adventure at 1st level. </p> <p> <span class=\"level\">2</span> The PCs should become 2nd level during their attempt to liberate downtown Willowshore—if you’re using milestones to level up, the PCs should reach 2nd level upon defeating the second of the three monstrous ringleaders that now control central Willowshore. </p> <p> <span class=\"level\">3</span> The PCs should be 3rd level before they begin Chapter 4. </p> <p>The PCs should reach 4th level by the time they complete the adventure.</p> </section>"

Not so long ago, monsters and ghosts were bedtime stories; the citizens of the sparsely populated province had a proud oral history of their ancestors’ resilience despite the terrors they faced. But their own day-to-day lives instead faced a less supernatural threat: oppression from the empire of Lung Wa.</p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 governorshanbaoheh.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 governorshanbaoheh.webp')\" /> <p>Lung Wa didn’t intentionally treat Shenmen poorly, but the empire’s practice of using postings to Shenmen to punish politicians and soldiers with an “undesirable assignment in the backwoods” created a cycle of oppression. As long as silver and fine lumber continued to be exported to greater Lung Wa, Shenmen’s appointed governors and guards were mostly left to their own devices.</p> <p>Over the years, the local government grew more corrupt. Those whom Lung Wa had sent to the province to be taught a lesson in humility instead learned that, as long as they produced goods for their superiors, they could run their own fiefdoms in whatever way best served themselves.</p> <p>This situation only grew worse after Lung Wa’s collapse. With no one above them, the leaders of Shenmen showed their true colors and became despots and tyrants—but not for long. The ghosts and monsters of Shenmen’s history had never truly left—they’d merely been waiting. When they swept down from the Gossamer Mountains and emerged from the deepest vales of Spectrewood, Shenmen’s corrupt leaders were the first to fall.</p> <p>This resurgence was no reprieve for the people of Shenmen. It was merely a changing of the guard, as many of the slaughtered leaders rose from death as ghosts or transformed into monsters themselves. Today, the people live lives of fear, with annual traditions (such as @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow]{Willowshore's} “season of ghosts”) in place to ensure proper offerings are regularly given in return for one more year of fearful subsistence.</p> <h1 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Welcome to Willowshore\">Welcome to Willowshore</h1> <p>“The Summer That Never Was” begins in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow]{Willowshore}, an isolated, self-sufficient settlement that scrapes by year after year with regular offerings and rituals designed to keep the ghosts and monsters at bay. Today, Willowshore is abandoned and haunted, but for much of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, the action takes place in a phantasmagoric mindscape of the town where the souls of the PCs and villagers alike have been trapped for over a century, unwittingly repeating the same dismal year again and again, unaware that they were accidently slain by their governor, Heh Shan-Bao.</p> <p>While these trapped souls unknowingly repeat the year 7108 ic over and over, the living world moved on. Over the course of a century, Willowshore fell into ruin, despite a few half-hearted but doomed attempts to reclaim the settlement. It isn’t until the current year, 7223 ic, that a significant effort to reclaim Willowshore finally begins. </p> <p>At the command of Chou Mingxia, the ghostly ruler of the city of Sze, a lumber baron named Mago Kai turned his sights to Willowshore. Mago Kai is one of Sze’s cruel success stories, but when several disasters caused closures at his other lumber camps, he was forced to look further afield from Sze to honor the commitments he’d made to Chou Mingxia. When Mago’s scouts discovered the ruins of Willowshore, he set upon the settlement with swift urgency, establishing a base of operations at a nearby coastal fortress named Karahai after finding Willowshore to be in an unlivable state of disrepair. However, Mago Kai sees potential in the abandoned town—if he uses what resources he still has to rebuild Willowshore, he knows he can turn a profit in time for next spring’s offering to Chou Mingxia. </p> <p>There’s only one problem: the ruins of Willowshore are haunted. The village’s spectral inhabitants include its long-dead and long-trapped citizens... and the PCs.</p> <aside class=\"sidebar\"> <h1>Shenmen</h1> <p>While some nations in Tian Xia are inspired more closely by certain real-life cultures, Shenmen is instead primarily inspired by horror traditions taken from a wide range of real-world stories. It’s a fictional nation and isn’t meant to represent more than these traditions of supernatural horror. During this nation’s history, it was conquered by Lung Wa, picked up immigrants from Hwanggot, and was taken over by jorogumo. It has a mix of cultures as a result, and its people have adopted words from multiple languages for their names and places. In Shenmen, ghosts and monsters are a very real part of life, and the practices employed by its people arise not from superstition but from necessity.</p> </aside> <p>To those within Willowshore’s mindscape, it’s the first day of summer in the year 7108, just at the beginning of the so-called “season of ghosts,” when Spectrewood sees an increase in activity from hauntings, restless spirits, and undead. Every year, on the final day of spring in 7109, the mindscape and its trapped inhabitants reset back to that first day of summer in 7108. This cycle has repeated itself over and over as time in the living realm marched onward, until the arrival of Mago Kai in the year 7223, a full 115 years after Willowshore’s doom.</p> <p>It’s that first day of summer in Willowshore—the 115th first day of that same summer, unknown to the mindscape’s inhabitants—when this campaign begins.</p> <h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Playing Season of Ghosts\">Playing Season of Ghosts</h2> <p>The Season of Ghosts Player’s Guide is a free PDF available at paizo.com. This adventure assumes the players use that document to help build their characters, but if you choose not to use the Player’s Guide in your campaign, let your players know that this Adventure Path isn’t set in a contemporary time—it instead takes place a few years after the onset of the Age of Lost Omens, in the year of 7108.</p> <h1>Campaign Timeline</h1> <p>Key events that led to the start of Season of Ghosts are presented below. Note that these dates use the Imperial Calendar, not Absalom Reckoning. To convert a date to Absalom Reckoning, subtract 2,500 from the year.</p> <table> <tbody><tr> <th>Date</th> <th>Event</th> </tr> <tr> <td>6223</td> <td>A heroic adventurer named Tan Sui-Jing defeats the powerful fiend Kugaptee but dies herself as the battle concludes. Her body sprouts a sugi tree over Kugaptee’s remains, trapping the fiend below the roots and preventing him from returning to life.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7020</td> <td>The remote village of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow]{Willowshore} is founded by a follower of Sangpotshi named Zhi Hui. She builds a Sangpotshi monastery in the mountain hinterlands, incorporating Tan Sui-Jing’s sugi tree (and thus Kugaptee’s grave) at the heart of the monastery’s courtyard.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7054</td> <td>Zhi Hui passes away of natural causes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7060</td> <td>Willowshore becomes a lumber town. Local Sangpotshi traditions dwindle. The monks of the Tan Sugi monastery, bereft of Zhi Hui’s guidance, bicker and abandon the monastery.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7062</td> <td>Chou Mingxia, the leader of the city of Sze, sends her son to Willowshore, where he attempts to harvest the glorious sugi tree. His attempt fails but does allow Kugaptee’s influence to spread, resulting in a mysterious tragedy that would come to be known as the Night of Broken Blades.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7102</td> <td>Governor Heh Shan-Bao is installed at Willowshore by Lung Wa.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7106</td> <td>Age of Lost Omens begins.

The four parts of this Adventure Path are organized accordingly. The first adventure introduces the story, setting, and characters while presenting the central issues and plot points. The second adventure is when the action of the plot takes center stage and the story escalates. The third introduces an unexpected twist or turning point in the storyline and serves as the plot’s climax. Finally, the last adventure focuses on the results and ramifications of the story, concludes the events, and explores lessons learned.</p> <aside class=\"sidebar\"> <h1>Preserving Surprises</h1> <p>This Adventure Path has several surprises for the players to uncover as they play, most notably that they’ve been trapped in a time loop in between life and death, and that if they want to return to the real world, they’ll have to reincarnate back into either their old bodies or entirely new ones. The Adventure Path still works fine if some or all of these surprises are spoiled for players, but you might want to let your players know when the campaign begins that Season of Ghosts includes some plot twists, and that if a player happens to know some or all of them, to please keep that knowledge to themselves to preserve the surprise for the others at the table.</p> <p>If some or all of your players figure things out early or have had these plot twists spoiled, resist the urge to change the developments at the last minute to “preserve surprise” since it can be just as satisfying to experience a storyline that you’ve correctly anticipated. Instead, neither confirm nor deny correct guesses; simply remind the players, “We’ll see how it all plays out by the end, won’t we?”</p> </aside> <h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"The Summer That Never Was\">The Summer That Never Was</h2> <strong> <p>By Sen H.H.S.</p> <p>Pathfinder Adventure Path #196, Levels 1–3</p> </strong> <p>The PCs find Willowshore infested with monsters.

The expedition arrived to find an overgrown and haunted ruin, but it was still full of potential. Could the place be reclaimed as a lumber camp? As they began planning, one of the ruin’s remaining guardians—a stone spider guardian beast—attacked the group of prospective loggers. Several people perished before Mago Kai defeated the stone spider, and he decided the group should retreat east to recuperate after their losses. He settled into the coastal fortress of Karahai and began to prepare for a more organized reconstruction effort, gathering the supplies, soldiers, and exorcists needed to cleanse Willowshore’s ruins and reclaim it from its haunted past. </p> <p> Unbeknownst to Mago Kai, the haunting effects he and his people experienced in the ruins of Willowshore were from more than merely unquiet spirits. These phenomena were the spiritual echoes and influences that reached out from within a mindscape version of Willowshore that came into existence 115 years before, when the city’s governor attempted (and failed) to perform a complex ritual meant to protect the town from the influence of an ancient fiend named Kugaptee. That failure resulted in the deaths of everyone in Willowshore, and left their souls trapped in a mindscape. The death of the town’s guardian spirit, the stone spider once known to its locals by the name Ugly Cute, set into motion a series of events that may make Mago Kai’s goal of reclaiming Willowshore for his own use impossible. </p> <p> In previous years, the end of the mindscape’s annual cycle reset everything back to the previous year’s first day of summer, and all those trapped within the mindscape woke again in their beds with no memories of the previous year’s events. But with Ugly Cute’s death during the final days of spring, something strange happened. Without the spiritual protection afforded by the guardian beast, Kugaptee’s influence grew even more quickly. It created a ghostly shell around the deeper regions of Willowshore’s hinterlands, manifesting in the mindscape as a frightening “Wall of Ghosts.” As Kugaptee slowly woke from his death slumber, the fiend’s thoughts manifested in physical form, infesting the mindscape with all manner of monstrous creatures. Many of these monsters invaded Willowshore and overran the town in the final days of spring, disrupting the townsfolk’s preparations for the upcoming season of ghosts and devastating many of the town’s structures. Three of these creatures in particular—a gluttonous buso named Gurglegut, a vain ittan-momen named Gray Butcher, and a hedonistic rokurokubi named Mo Douqiu—became ringleaders for these manifested monstrosities, and their bullying leadership proved key to the town’s fall. </p> <p> When the mindscape reverted back to the first day of summer a few days after this disaster, things had changed forever, for these new manifestations born from Kugaptee’s thoughts didn’t reset with the rest of the mindscape. For the first time in 115 years, the people of Willowshore woke to a town infested with monsters and savaged by mayhem—but without any memories of how these events had come to pass. </p> <p> Ugly Cute found itself alive once again when the cycle reset, but this time it was trapped in the mindscape itself. The stone spider quickly went into action, attacking and fighting back against the invading monsters. Fortunately for the PCs, among the creatures Ugly Cute encounters and drives off are the same noppera-bos who were in the process of dragging the unconscious PCs out of town and to the east to torment. With the rising of the sun, the PCs awaken in a familiar forest clearing along with memories of the previous night that are at odds with the reality they now face. Where they go from here could lead to the destruction of the mindscape and the return of Willowshore’s trapped souls to life—or to their true deaths after a long-delayed trip to the Boneyard. </p>"

Allow the PCs to attempt @Check[survival|dc:10] or @Check[willowshore-lore|dc:10] checks—anyone who succeeds realizes that they’ve instead awoken in a clearing east of Willowshore and that a nearby game trail leads west back toward town. If no PC attempts this check, the trail is easy to notice, and the fact that it leads downhill toward the sound of a river is enough to suggest that it likely leads back toward home. </p> <p> The weather this morning is typical for Shenmen in the early summer—partially overcast with a crisp early morning chill to the air that, by noon, the PCs might expect to give way to a more pleasant but not overbearing heat. As the day draws on, the clouds only grow more ominous, and rain begins to fall. </p> <p> Give the players a chance to introduce their characters if they haven’t done so already.

If not, or if you wish to remind them of some key elements, make sure they know the following before starting this adventure. </p> <p> What is the season of ghosts? The season of ghosts is a time during summer when Spectrewood sees an increase in hauntings, spirits, and undead. While the cause is uncertain, these ghosts often lure folks to their deaths. </p> <p> What is the Reenactment Festival? In Willowshore, following a massive feast to celebrate the end of the season on the last day of spring, the town reenacts people being snatched away by “ghosts” (played by villagers in paper masks); the townsfolk then pretend to plunge into collective panic as designated wailers mourn loudly, while others play out a search and rescue effort. This farce is believed to trick real ghosts into thinking that someone has already haunted the settlement and thus convince them to seek a happier village to inflict misery upon. The PCs recall playing the role of the abductees, who must spend the night wrapped in straw mats until they’re “ransomed” in the morning by the local in charge of that year’s Reenactment Festival. </p> <p> What items do the PCs have? Staying overnight in the woods is risky, and the PCs were given time to prepare in advance. They currently have whatever items most 1st-level adventurers start with, as determined during character creation. </p> </aside> <p> After the PCs talk for a bit, they notice something else is amiss. The main organizer of the ritual this year, the miller Choe Chung-hu, said he would arrive by sunrise with food to “ransom” the PCs and lead them back home. This step isn’t essential; it’s more of a breakfast delivery to thank those who helped with the reenactment. The PCs know that they can go back to Willowshore without this ransom being delivered, as if they safely “escaped from their kidnappers.” However, Choe’s absence is strange since the miller seldom goes back on his word. </p> <p> If the PCs head back toward town, remember to ask each PC what Exploration Activity they use on the trip. If instead they decide to wait a while in the clearing, they can explore the location with activities such as Investigate or Detect Magic to check for anything out of place. Regardless of their choice, the “Strange Aggression” encounter that follows takes place at this time. </p>"

On a critical failure, a PC misremembers an old legend that claims summer fog brings summer sickness. On a success, a PC recalls an old nursery rhyme that suggests Willowshore’s <em>Eternal Lantern</em> has been extinguished. See the lantern poem below for this rhyme. </p> <blockquote class=\"read-aloud\"> <p>Lazy Adou took a break, and</p> <p>did not light the lamp that day.</p> <p>This proved to be a big mistake, for</p> <p>then the ghosts came out to play!</p> <p>Hazy mist and moon of blood,</p> <p>all because he just gave up.</p> <cite>Lantern Poem</cite> </blockquote> <p> As long as Willowshore’s <em>Eternal Latern</em> remains extinguished, day and night are more dangerous and unsettling. During the day, the town is constantly bathed in a thick fog known as mirage mist. The mist dissipates at night, but at the cost of crimson moonlight bathing the land. </p> <p> <strong>Mirage Mist:</strong> The eerie fog is thick enough to obscure visibility beyond a range of 500 feet. Creatures viewed from more than 100 feet away are concealed. In addition, the mist distorts peripheral vision, causing one to periodically notice strange shapes moving and shifting about at the limits of their vision. All Perception checks attempted within mirage mist suffer a –1 status penalty as a result, and all DCs for Survival checks to Sense Direction are increased by 5. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform:scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-199-season-of-ghosts/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital\" /> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Scene Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Ambiance</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Playlist.YMBqSrJs9w6YzO97.PlaylistSound.WFKfpeNXp7yQ2DXV]{Mist Urban} @UUID[Playlist.YMBqSrJs9w6YzO97.PlaylistSound.QQhDyDdKSeqw2UMI]{Mist Nature}</span> </div> </section> <p> <strong>Crimson Moon:</strong> At night, the mirage mist clears and the sky reverts to partially overcast.

On a success, the cloud cover increases fully (this doesn’t negate the need to make hourly Will saves against the crimson moon while outdoors), and at some point during the night (as decided by the GM), what appears to be blood rains down on Willowshore. This “blood” seemingly coats everything with a layer of gore. Any PC who witnesses the blood rain must immediately attempt a save against the effects of the crimson moon, taking a –4 circumstance penalty to the save if they’re out in the rain.

A PC who succeeds at a @Check[occultism|dc:15|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] or @Check[religion|dc:15|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge knows these animals are being influenced in some way by an evil spirit. These animals—along with many other aggressive animals encountered in the mindscape during this chapter—are physical manifestations of Kugaptee’s influence over the region.

Willowshore’s eastern entrance lantern, once held in the stone spider’s fangs, now lies extinguished on its side in the grass below. </p> <p> Allow the PCs a @Check[society|dc:15|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] or @Check[willowshore-lore|dc:15|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge about the stone spider statue, as detailed in area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06spidergate0000]{W30}</strong>.

With a successful @Check[survival|dc:15|traits:secret,concentrate,exploration,move,skill,action:track|name:Track] check to Track, a PC confirms these marks are consistent with tracks the statue would’ve left if it animated and headed east down the road. The tracks then enter the river and become impossible to follow. The PCs have no way of knowing it at the moment, but later in the adventure, they’ll discover what happened to Ugly Cute—see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19604thewil.JournalEntryPage.04searchingfor00]{Searching for Ugly Cute} in Chapter 3. </p> <p> <strong>The Unlit Lantern:</strong> The entrance lantern is empty of oil. While this lantern won’t drive back the mist and moonlight if it’s lit again, if the PCs refill it (they can find lantern oil in the next encounter if they don’t have any at this time), they gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against the crimson moonlight, and the flat check for blood rain increases to @Check[flat|dc:18]. </p> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> Give the PCs 20 XP for lighting the lantern. </p>"

The tang of blood fills the air, and four bodies lie sprawled on the ground. Two belong to town guards, their legs swollen and expressions of pain frozen on their faces. The other two bodies appear to be tiny blue-gray humanoids with sharp teeth and giant ears, seemingly slain by sword blows. </p> <p> A PC who succeeds at a @Check[nature|dc:15|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge identifies the two tiny humanoid bodies as jinkin gremlins. Any character who examines the two human guards and succeeds at a @Check[medicine|dc:13] check realizes they perished from poison delivered from snake bites to the legs. A PC who Searches the area reveals two dead vipers in the grass nearby. </p> <p> <strong>Creatures:</strong> Up in the guard tower, a town guard named Hai-er Ha managed to escape death. When she sees the PCs, she demands they recite at least four of the eight practices of the season of ghosts to prove they aren’t monsters in disguise. These eight practices are listed in the sidebar on page 13 and in the Season of Ghosts Player’s Guide. If you’re not using the guide, or if the players have trouble remembering the practices, a character can recall two randomly rolled practices with a successful @Check[religion|dc:10|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge], @Check[society|dc:10|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge], or @Check[willowshore-lore|dc:10|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge (or four on a critical success, one on a failure, and none on a critical failure). A PC can also get Hai-er to relax by Making an Impression with a successful @Check[diplomacy|dc:15|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression] check to shift her attitude from unfriendly to at least indifferent. </p> <aside class=\"sidebar\"> <h1>The Eight Practices</h1> <p> The people of Willowshore follow these eight tenets during the season of ghosts. These beliefs are held as protections against the attentions of minor evil or mischievous spirits and, as such, can be used against the phantoms that plague Willowshore early on. However, they’re generally ineffective against more powerful undead or actual ghosts the party will face in later adventures, and any local or PC who knows these practices would know this as well. </p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Do not call a ghost a ghost; instead, address them with friendly greetings if you must.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Do not pat people on the head or shoulders.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Avoid entering bodies of water when a ghost is nearby.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Do not eat food that has two stick-like objects protruding from it.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Do not lean against walls during the day.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Do not whistle at night.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Do not leave laundry out at night.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> If you hear someone call your name from behind you at night, do not turn around.</p> </aside> <p> Once she’s convinced, her attitude shifts to indifferent if it wasn’t there already, and she clambers down from the tower to greet the PCs with relief. While she doesn’t know any of them personally, she certainly remembers yesterday evening when Uncle Choe and his crew in their ghostly paper masks carried the PCs out to the woods at the culmination of the Reenactment Festival. She also confirms they returned from the woods without the PCs a short time later, just at the beginning of her watch. It was well after midnight that those “horrible little blue monsters” came out of the woods to the south with their trained serpents. The other two guards on duty managed to defeat the creatures but then perished to snake bites. Hai-er has remained in the watchtower, plagued by a mix of fear and guilt ever since, and the dense fog that has descended on Willowshore frightens her all the more. If no PC recalled the rhyme about Lazy Adou earlier, she could share it with them. </p> <p> She warns the PCs that screams, roars, and other frightening sounds have been echoing through the air from town, but that since dawn, things have been silent. She’s incredulous if the PCs tell her Ugly Cute’s statue is missing. Hai-er prefers to stay here in the tower “until this weird fog lifts,” and she promises to ring the tower bell if she spots any danger. If more than 24 hours have passed, she is running low on food and will make her way into town—her fate is left to the GM to determine in this encounter. </p> <p>Hai-er has some advice for the PCs before they leave the watchtower.</p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 hai-erha.webp\" alt=\"A woman in oriental style armored helmet\" title=\"Hai-er Ha\" style=\"z-index:5;shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 hai-erha.webp')\" /> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> “Go home, check on friends and family, make sure everyone is all right. That’s what I would do if not for this fog. Pharasma bless us, I hope my daughter is okay. Even though I asked Granny Hu to babysit, I worry. And my husband... hopefully he’s safe at the Matsuki estate right now. That place is nearly a fortress!” </p> <p> All PCs know that “Granny Hu” refers to Hu Ban-niang, and the Matsuki estate is Shou’s home—though he’s more commonly called “Old Matsuki.” These two individuals are the spiritual leaders of Willowshore’s Northridge and Southbank factions, respectively. The PCs can invite Hai-er to join them, though she initially resists due to a combination of her fear of what’s happening all around her and her dedication to her post. If she can be made at least friendly, she’ll agree to accompany the PCs. She encourages them to either visit Granny Hu (so she can check on her daughter) or the Matsuki estate (to track down her husband)—if the PCs neglect either of these options before nightfall, she’ll set off to reunite with her daughter on her own. As long as she’s accompanying the PCs, Hai-er provides support in combat with her crossbow, closing to melee only once she runs out of ammunition. If reduced to fewer than 6 Hit Points, she panics and flees, hoping to find somewhere safe to hide before moving on to seek out her daughter. Once she’s reunited with either her daughter or husband, she no longer accompanies the PCs. </p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>@UUID[Actor.wgZsghJfKH3NAu7W]{Hai-er Ha}</span> <span>Creature 1</span> </h2> </section> <p> <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.cgVYv0bAVk3J8LrF]{Hai-er's Supplies}<br /> Hai-er provides the party with two minor magical supplies from the watchtower that might be of use to them—a ladder feather token and a single shining crossbow bolt.

And as with the centipedes in that encounter, these wild animals are chaotic evil and can speak—but do so mostly to issue threats or taunt their victims; they have no interest in actual conversations. </p> <p> <strong>Haunts:</strong> For each haunt encounter, two options for haunts taken from Pathfinder Book of the Dead are given—choose the one that makes the most sense for the situation the PCs are in at the time. All six of the haunts mentioned on this table are detailed fully on pages 64–65 of Book of the Dead. You can use these six haunts as inspiration to craft more haunts to vex your players with if you wish. </p> <p> <strong>Jinkin:</strong> Encounters with these gremlins are either with a lone jinkin or with a jinkin and their pet viper. A jinkin flees if reduced to fewer than 5 Hit Points, but a pet viper fights to the death. Many of these jinkins have stolen mundane objects from locals and either wear them in strange ways or are in the process of destroying the object. Note that all of the jinkins encountered in this adventure speak Common, rather than Undercommon. </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 phantomwolf.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 phantomwolf.webp')\" /> <p> <strong>Phantoms:</strong> These creatures are the closest thing to actual ghosts the PCs are likely to face this early in the Adventure Path. These phantom animals are manifestations of Kugaptee’s influence as much as they are of Willowshore’s collective fears and superstitions. As such, these phantoms might call out a PC’s name when they’re looking away, or might appear as the result of a PC entering a body of water or daring to whistle at night. The most important thing for the PCs to note is that by using the first practice and addressing these phantoms with friendly greetings, the PCs can cause them to lose their power and even discorporate. Allow the PCs to attempt a secret @Check[religion|dc:15|traits:secret] or @Check[willowshore-lore|dc:15|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge] check to realize this tactic if they don’t come up with it themselves after encountering a phantom. These phantoms appear as ghostly, pale green versions of the real animal, but have eerie glowing eyes and can speak Common. Phantoms, when encountered, are more eager to frighten the PCs than to fight, and until they’re attacked, they’ll only use their innate occult spells or Intimidation checks to Demoralize. Once a phantom is attacked, it fights back with its melee strikes. These wandering phantoms can’t pursue victims into buildings and vanish back into the Ethereal Plane at the end of any round in which they see no viable targets outside on the streets. </p>"

While the PCs recuperate, Old Matsuki asks them what happened after they woke up in the forest. After the PCs recount their experience, he is sympathetic and encourages anyone with missing family members to stay optimistic. He offers lodgings if the PCs feel their homes aren’t secure enough to stay in. </p> <p> Once the PCs have had a chance to relax a bit, Old Matsuki asks for their help in retaking Willowshore. In particular, he mentions the following four topics as goals for the PCs to tackle. The order in which they attempt these quests is left to the PCs to decide. </p> <p> <strong>Contacting Northridge:</strong> With the monsters encamped on Dawnstep Bridge, easy access to Northridge is denied. Old Matsuki admits he has his differences with @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07bannianggran00]{Granny Hu}, but making contact with her and providing available aid to Northridge is important. If the PCs feel up to the task, Old Matsuki suggests seeking Granny Hu out at the trade office (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02makingcontac01]{Making Contact: Northridge}). </p> <p> <strong>Ugly Cute:</strong> Old Matsuki notes that several refugees have seen a horse-sized spider made of stone striding through the mist, and he believes Willowshore’s stone guardian has awakened to defend the town; the PCs can confirm this theory by reporting the missing statue. He plans on recruiting the hunters from the Silvermist Lodges (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06silvermistlo00]{W5}</strong>) to track down Ugly Cute to provide aid to the guardian beast, but currently, the hunters are busy saving townsfolk in the streets. If the PCs can contact one of the hunters, Old Matsuki asks them to convey this information to them (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02thetrappedhu00]{The Trapped Hunter}). </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 oldmatsuki.webp\" alt=\"An eldery man\" title=\"Old Matsuki\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 oldmatsuki.webp')\" /> <p> <strong>The Invading Monsters:</strong> Old Matsuki warns the PCs about the buso and jinkins on Dawnstep Bridge (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06dawnstepbrid00]{W11}</strong>; see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02liberatingth00]{Liberating the Bridge}). He shares survivor reports that the jinkins appear to be afraid of fighting beside the buso, and that directly confronting the buso or calling it out specifically for a challenge might be one way to defeat the monster without having to contend with the gremlins simultaneously. He also notes that the buso seems taken with drink, and he suggests that if the PCs think they can trick the monster, they could approach it with an offering of drugged or poisoned wine to make it easier to defeat. Old Matsuki suggests paying a visit to the Hand of Spring (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06thehandofspr00]{W19}</strong>) if the PCs are interested in pursuing this option (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02clashatthecl00]{Clash at the Clinic}). </p> <p> <strong>The Unlit Lantern:</strong> Old Matsuki suspects that the cause of the strange weather affecting Willowshore (and thus an important step in retaking the town) is tied to the fact that, for the first time since it was lit generations ago, the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> has gone dark. He knows the history of the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> and shares with the PCs the story of how Master Zhi Hui first lit the lantern using three blessed copper coins. To relight the lantern and, hopefully, bring an end to the strange mist and unsettling crimson moonlight, the PCs must obtain the blessing of three gods by visiting three different shrines and offering a copper coin to receive the blessing. It only takes 10 minutes for Old Matsuki to teach the PCs how to perform the prayer; he provides the PCs with three copper coins as tokens to offer (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02blessingthec00]{Blessing the Coins}). Once the PCs have three blessed coins, they should make haste to Dawnstep Bridge to relight the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02lightthenigh00]{Light the Night}). </p> <p> <strong>Downtown Willowshore:</strong> In closing, Old Matsuki warns the PCs against entering downtown Willowshore at this time, for reports indicate that this part of town has become particularly infested with monsters. Once the four tasks above have been accomplished (in particular, the lighting of the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> ), plans for dealing with downtown can proceed. </p> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 40 XP for meeting Old Matsuki for the first time in this adventure. </p>"

The fisheries (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06fisheries00000]{W22}</strong> ) and even the Mushroom House (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02shrinelocati00]{W24}</strong> ) have also opened their doors to accommodate the influx of villagers. Compared to the Matsuki estate, there are fewer refugees at the trade office, both because the NPCs downtown are trapped and because several locals have intentionally distanced themselves from Granny Hu, but making contact with those holed up at the trade office is still an important step toward reclaiming Willowshore from the monsters. </p>"

Worse, many of the rowboats in town have been damaged by destructive jinkins. A character who Searches for 10 minutes along the southern bank and succeeds at a @Check[perception|dc:13|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,action:search|name:Search] check can find a broken @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.vehicles.Actor.l0RfYgabnbNoHnkS]{Rowboat}, while with a critical success, they locate an undamaged rowboat. </p> <p> Larger boats and barges are moored at various places along the northern shore, but these vehicles are likely beyond the capacity of a low-level party to pilot. Fortunately, characters can automatically find a functional rowboat on the river’s northern bank after taking 10 minutes to Search. </p> <p> See the Gamemastery Guide for vehicle rules (pages 174–177). </p> </aside> <p> As long as monsters retain control of Dawnstep Bridge (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06dawnstepbrid00]{W11}</strong>), traveling between Northridge and Southbank is tricky, as the waters of Woodraft Lake and the Ceiba River present a significant barrier. </p> <p> <strong>Ceiba River:</strong> The Ceiba River varies between 20 and 25 feet deep with very little shallows along either shore—a feature that traditionally made the river very well suited for the transport of lumber. A PC can Swim the river’s waters with a successful @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:swim|name:Swim] check or cross in a rowboat via Piloting checks (see page 175 in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide, but note that a critical failure on a Piloting check results in a capsize and the boat sinking). Make sure to remind the players of the third practice of the season of ghosts—that one should “avoid entering bodies of water when a ghost is nearby.” In this case, entering a body of water could mean physically entering it or even attempting to pilot a boat across water. While there are no game mechanics in play to back up this implied danger, you can make your players a bit uneasy and nervous about crossing the river simply by reminding them of this superstition. </p> <p> <strong>Willowshore Dam:</strong> The dam (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06willowshored00]{W14}</strong> ) is currently open. A character can close it as a 10-minute activity to Interact with the dam’s mechanisms on either shore by succeeding at a @Check[athletics|dc:15] or @Check[engineering-lore|dc:13] check. Each attempt to close (or open) the dam incurs a flat check for a @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19602toligh.JournalEntryPage.02randomencoun00]{Random Encounter}, and a critical failure indicates the mechanism has become stuck and can’t be opened or closed again until it’s repaired with several days of work. </p> <p> Once the dam is closed, the waters of the Ceiba River lower to a depth of 10 feet, and the DC to Swim or Pilot a boat is reduced by 5 for 2 hours, after which the water level of Woodraft Lake rises enough to drain over the dam’s spillways, reverting the waters to their former depth and speed. Opening the dam at this point increases the river depth back to normal and increases checks to cross it by 5 for 15 minutes. </p> <p> A PC can treat the dam itself as an improvised bridge, but its slick surface and narrow spots mean that to do so requires that PC to succeed at five @Check[acrobatics|dc:17|traits:move,skill,action:balance|name:Balance] checks to balance during an intense 5-minute crossing. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/mini/Hazard-MINI.webp\" /> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Crossing the Waters</span> <span>Moderate 1</span> </h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.8gY5VNj7ZC0ggCF0]{Grasping Currents}</span> </div> <p> <strong>Woodraft Lake:</strong> While the waters of Woodraft Lake (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06woodraftlake00]{W13}</strong> ) are calmer (reduce checks to Swim and Pilot by 5), the bodies of dead townsfolk float in the waters, either tossed here unceremoniously by monsters or, more tragically, the results of failed attempts by frightened people trying to cross the waters.

Granny Hu questions how the PCs managed to cross the river, fearing they might have been forced to strike a bargain with the monsters. Once the PCs explain, Granny Hu shakes her head and chuckles at the party’s foolish bravery. She asks them to sit and update her on what they’ve been through, feigning concern for the folks in the south. </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 grannyhu.webp\" alt=\"An elderly woman with salt and pepper hair\" title=\"Granny Hu\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 grannyhu.webp')\" /> <p> Granny Hu is forced to reluctantly agree with Old Matsuki about the three most important steps that must be taken next, but if the PCs come to her first, she eagerly suggests the following tasks on her own, providing somewhat different advice. </p> <p> <strong>The Invading Monsters:</strong> Granny Hu has heard rumors that the “brain” of the monsters that invaded Willowshore is someone (or something) named Mo Douqiu. She believes he might either be a human with occult powers or some sort of human-like yokai. She sees Northridge as being more self-sufficient, and restoring access to Dawnstep Bridge is, to her, less important than defeating the creatures that now control downtown Willowshore. </p> <p> <strong>Ugly Cute:</strong> Granny Hu did hear from some survivors that the spider statue has gone missing, but she finds the idea of the stone statue “waking up on its own” to be ridiculous superstition. If anything, she suspects the statue might have been animated by magic, or perhaps it has become haunted. Since the source of its mobility is unknown, she warns against assumptions that Ugly Cute is friendly, though she doesn’t see it as a foremost threat that needs to be handled. </p> <p> <strong>The Unlit Lantern:</strong> While Granny Hu only vaguely knows the legend of the <em>Eternal Lantern</em>, Kim can recount how Master Zhi Hui lit the lantern with coins blessed by Calistria, Kofusachi, and Shelyn and suggests that seeking their shrines for blessings might be the best tactic. </p>"

On a success, they find their way to a small farm where a strange commotion is taking place. </p> <p>Use map the map for Small Farm for this encounter.</p> <p> <strong>Creatures:</strong> A pair of jinkins by the names of Midori and Murasaki, plus two mean-spirited animals (a weasel named Noodles and a raven named Sparrow), have trapped one of the Silvermist hunters, a half-elf named Sumika. She was tricked into investigating this farm by the creatures’ voices, which she mistook for crying children. After being critically wounded by a spring-loaded spear trap the gremlins rigged in the farmhouse’s southwest communal room, Sumika managed to crawl into the southern bedroom and barricaded the door. </p> <p> The four are now gathered near the entrance to the southwest building, calling out taunts to Sumika. “Blue like the dawn! Purple and miraculous! Swift like a fawn! Together, we are the Abacus Sisters!” cry out the two jinkins. As their nonsense rhyme concludes and they fall into a fit of cackling, Noodles elaborates, “That means we’re here to steal all your cattle!” Sparrow remains perched on the roof above the entrance, calling out to Sumika as if trying to lure out a trapped cat with a high-pitched, “Here, kitty, kitty! Come on out and get a treat!” </p> <p> These four mischievous tormentors aren’t particularly interested in fighting the PCs. Rather, they seek to “befriend” animals by taking them by force and have mistaken Sumika for this farm’s rancher. If any PCs have a companion animal, familiar, mount, or eidolon, the group fixates on the most powerful-looking of them, using a combination of obviously untrustworthy promises of food and outright threats to try to get the animal to join them. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/mini/Noodles-MINI.webp\" /> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">The Trapped Hunter</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Severe 1</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.DQa6xlHhsUIsazxD]{Midori} @UUID[Actor.Xe7ZAOH9lvc1fGt0]{Murasaki} @UUID[Actor.oV1GSk5LE9iYY9j5]{Noodles} @UUID[Actor.uMSPvdmGCi3hZPGx]{Sparrow} @UUID[Actor.K8GED3qowMBZPJv4]{Sumika}</span> </div> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 sumika.webp\" alt=\"A young woman with dark hair in a long braid\" title=\"Sumika\" style=\"z-index:5;shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 sumika.webp')\" /> <p> While the PCs can certainly fight the Abacus Sisters, this is a dangerous encounter.

Think you’ve got the wits to win out against the Abacus Sisters?” Sparrow chirps out a snarky, “I doubt it! I do! I doubt it! Don’t you?” Once it becomes obvious there are visitors, Sumika leans up to peer out of a window in the room and mouths the words “Help me!” to the PCs after waving a hand to attract their attention. </p> </section> <p> To help Sumika make her escape, the PCs can engage with the Abacus Sisters in a “battle of wits.” Allow the players to engage in any sort of conversation they wish, then have each of them attempt a @Check[deception|dc:13], @Check[diplomacy|dc:13], or @Check[intimidation|dc:13] check, as they see fit.

You should also allow each PC to attempt a secret @Check[society|dc:17|traits:secret] or a @Check[farming-lore|dc:15|traits:secret] check to realize a mistake the four made—if they point out that the word “abactor” is the one that means “one who steals cattle,” not “abacus,” the four immediately fall to bickering and arguing among themselves about the revelation, allowing the PCs to automatically win the battle of wits. </p> <p> If the PCs manage to distract the Abacus Sisters, Sumika can clamber out through the window to limp away to safety. The PCs can then follow, leaving the bickering creatures behind before they can attack. Otherwise, the Abacus Sisters grow impatient and decide to attack the PCs.

Some, such as Igawa Jubei (a wizard’s apprentice from Mother’s Coil, area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06motherscoil000]{W20}</strong>) and Huo Tian-Zhe (a tinkerer from Second Best, area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06secondbest0000]{W18}</strong>) are here due to injuries. Jubei badly sprained her ankle escaping from a jinkin contraption, while Tian-Zhe sports a large burn wound from a backfired alchemical explosion. </p> <p> When the PCs first arrive, the western half of the clinic appears to be boarded up and abandoned, but as they approach, the sounds of hissing, growling, and the thumping of a battle become apparent, seemingly coming from the eastern courtyard. They can plainly see several giant centipedes attacking a ghostly gecko the size of a human by peering through the wooden lattice separating the courtyard from the exterior path. </p> <p>Use the map for Hand of Spring to play out this encounter.</p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/mini/Phantom%20Gecko-MINI.webp\" /> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Clash at the Clinic</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Low 1</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.hDUn5fzvKGYlPZLG]{Giant Centipedes (3)} @UUID[Actor.0ZSSolniJcb6qFd1]{Phantom Gecko}</span> </div> <p> <strong>Creatures:</strong> Despite Doctor Dami’s precautions, giant centipedes have been attracted to the area by the presence of those sheltering in the building. The ghostly gecko is the manifestation of a guardian spirit that has long protected the clinic but has never been forced into being. As the PCs approach, the gecko is doing its best against two centipedes, but three more clamber out through gaps in the lattice to attack the PCs before they can even reach the front door. </p> <p> The centipedes fight to the death. While the phantom gecko itself isn’t a manifestation of the evil infusing the mindscape, it still regards the PCs as potential intruders. If the PCs defeat the three centipedes that attack them, the gecko finishes off its last centipede and then threatens the PCs by attempting to Demoralize them on its turn. It doesn’t initiate an attack, and one round after the last centipede is slain, Doctor Dami emerges from the western building and blurts out, “Don’t kill it!” with the hope of preventing the PCs from attacking the phantom gecko. If a round passes without any hostile action from the PCs after all the centipedes have been slain, the phantom gecko fades back into the Ethereal Plane. </p> </section> <p> <strong>Speaking to the Doctor:</strong> @UUID[Actor.OupSMsDWTwNTWvIb]{Dami's Thanks} @UUID[Actor.IITlVP8NOdzo65Oi]{Dami's Extra Thanks}<br /> If the PCs help defeat the centipedes, Doctor Dami gives them two lesser antidotes in thanks for their timely services. If they managed to spare the gecko from being killed as well, he also gives them a lesser darkvision elixir. He has five more vials of lesser darkvision elixirs, should the PCs be interested in buying or bartering for more. He also offers to use Treat Wounds on the PCs whenever they come to the clinic at no cost, so long as the monsters are still in town. </p> <p> If the PCs mention their intention to relight the <em>Eternal Lantern</em> , Doctor Dami opens his shrine to Qi Zhong for them to seek the god’s blessing. Also, Jubei informs the PCs about the Nalinivati shrine in Mother’s Coil (area <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06motherscoil000]{W20}</strong> ). </p> <p> As for Granny Hu’s concerns for his safety, Dami dismisses that concern with a wave of the hand, noting his disinterest in her posturing and politics. Despite the centipede attack, he still feels safe in his clinic and refuses to abandon it, noting that moving the wounded may do them more harm than good. If the PCs really want to help, they should work toward reclaiming Willowshore. </p> <p> Finally, if the PCs mention a plan to poison or drug the buso at Dawnstep Bridge, Doctor Dami nods grimly and admits he can help, although he makes it clear that he doesn’t normally condone poisoning. He supplies the PCs with a dose of dreamtime tea (Gamemastery Guide 121), warning them to be careful with it and to use it only against the monster (he keeps this small supply of the drug on hand for rare personal use and knows that it can be addictive). </p> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs let the phantom gecko live, they receive full XP as if they defeated it. </p>"

It’s said that the light from this lamp protects Willowshore from all manners of evil.

Citizens who have been hiding in their homes or gathering in safe zones emerge cautiously, yet the people of Willowshore remain frightened. Nothing like this has happened before, and the town’s leaders have their hands full keeping the citizens comfortable, safe, and calm. One notable part of town is still in danger, though: downtown Willowshore remains controlled by monsters, and any citizens who were trapped there remain prisoners or worse. More disturbing, now that the mists are gone, the light of day reveals something truly unsettling. The governor’s manor, once situated at the northeastern corner of downtown Willowshore, has vanished! </p> <p> At this point, the PCs should’ve met with Willowshore’s most influential elders, “Granny Hu” (@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07bannianggran00]{Ban-niang Hu}, representing Northridge) and “Old Matsuki” (@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07shouoldmatsu00]{Shou Matsuki}, representing Southbank). Both of these NPCs have full write-ups at the end of this adventure, including influence stat blocks the PCs can use to gain additional benefits. Both want the PCs to do what they can to liberate downtown while the elders focus on keeping their constituents safe during these troubled times. Which elder the PCs choose to work with is up to them, but their choice of which faction to support will help decide Willowshore’s future throughout the remainder of this campaign. </p>"

If asked what he means by a performance, Mo Douqiu curtly states the following: </p> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> “Dance! Sing! Fight! Whatever is entertaining! It’s what living is all about, so LIVE! Otherwise, make use of yourself and go feed Warty. As in, leave your treasure here and let that hungry critter just gobble you down.

Everyone’s working day-in, day-out, just to make ends meet. Every single year, doing the same thing over and over again. All that work just to survive.

It’s almost as if he wants to provoke the PCs into starting a fight. He won’t make the first attack, but once combat begins, he commands his remaining pets to rise to his defense. This includes Warty (if the giant toad still lives) and Stingy (if the cave scorpion still lives), but if the PCs have already defeated these two animals, Mo Douqiu can still rely upon his pet weasel, Fluffy Whiskers, to clamber out of his sleeves, launch off his shoulders, and fight at his side.

One evening during the third month of summer, this tension finally snaps as @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07shouoldmatsu00]{Old Matsuki} very publicly challenges @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07bannianggran00]{Granny Hu} for Willowshore’s leadership. </p> <p> The elders resolve to settle the question of leadership via a duel between chosen champions, drawing upon a Willowshore tradition for solving public disputes. The two set the date for this duel as seven days hence and part ways, leaving the rest of those present to begin gossiping about who might be representing whom, who yet holds a grudge against another, and even wonder if a third party might step into the conflict between Northridge and Southbank. As word spreads through town, dread grows as folks realize that a duel will likely lead to a bloodbath. Soon enough, an NPC close to the PCs asks them to de-escalate the situation, to stoutly stand with one of the factions, or to put themselves forward as a collective third candidate. Which NPC approaches the party is left to you to decide, but it should be someone the players trust. </p> <p> With seven days before the duel, the PCs have time to make a decision as to where they stand. Both Old Matsuki and Granny Hu extend invitations to the PCs to speak to them by the end of the day, for the support of those who relit the Eternal Lantern would go a long way toward establishing that faction’s legitimacy to claims of leadership, even if a PC doesn’t wish to be directly involved in the duel itself. In order to convince one of the two elders to step aside and let the other assume the leadership role, the PCs must reach 7 Influence Points with that elder. It’s possible that the PCs have already reached this level with one or both elders during play, in which case they can solve the issue by making the decision of who should be Willowshore’s interim governor until Governor Heh’s fate can finally be determined. Each elder’s influence stat block appears in their NPC entry at the end of this book. </p> <p> If the PCs fail to solve this problem, then you should select which elder wins the leadership, picking the one that the party is less in favor with. At your option, if the PCs are intrigued by a duel, you could even allow them to serve as one of the elders’ champions, using the rules for dueling (Gamemastery Guide 166–167). </p> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs convince one of the elders to cede to the other and achieve a peaceful resolution, grant the PCs 80 XP and 2 Reputation Points with the faction whose elder becomes the town’s leader. </p> <p>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19605thewal]{Chapter 4: The Wall of Ghosts}</p>"

The merchant appears friendly, but the timing of his arrival makes the townsfolk wary. </p> <p> Though this nondescript merchant looks like an average Tian man, he’s secretly a powerful entity in the service of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma}—a @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07shinigami00000]{Shinigami} named Asahina Shinzo who’s still undergoing penitence for an infraction against Pharasma made decades before the advent of the Age of Lost Omens. Explicitly barred from directly intervening in the fate of any mortal, Shinzo hopes that by doing what he can to help those trapped in Willowshore’s mindscape escape (be it back to life or on to death), he can repay his mysterious debt to the Lady of Graves. His raven accomplice is a nosoi psychopomp named Yix who remains in bird form at all times. Here to silently observe Shinzo, the nosoi gives no clue that he’s anything other than a friendly (if periodically noisy) raven. </p> <p> Likewise, Shinzo maintains his disguise as a human at all times, introducing himself to the PCs as a traveling salesperson who hopes to add Willowshore to his regular route. He offers his current wares to the PCs, opening his cart for them to shop through, but at this time, he has little to offer beyond minor items and supplies (any common item of up to 2nd level). Shinzo can also buy any items or equipment the PCs wish to sell, offering normal prices. </p> <p> His greatest service to the PCs, though, as he eagerly explains, is his capacity to obtain items the PCs might desire and to return with them for sale on a following visit. Initially, this service might not seem like a particular advantage, as the PCs can purchase much of what they need at lower levels from shops in Willowshore. However, as the Adventure Path progresses, Shinzo’s uncanny ability to come and go will become an increasingly important asset for the PCs, giving them access to shopping opportunities they otherwise wouldn’t have. </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 shinzo.webp\" alt=\"A man with a friendly smile wearing a wide brimmed hat\" title=\"Shinzo\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 shinzo.webp')\" /> <p> <strong>Shinzo’s Supplies:</strong> You can handle the supplies Shinzo offers in two ways. You can create a list of items for the PCs to shop through on each of his visits, filling his cart with a dozen various items of a level no higher than the party’s level, or you can allow your players to “place orders” for things. In this second system, items the PCs request are available for purchase upon Shinzo’s next visit to town, but again, the upper level limit of items he can offer for sale is set by the party’s level. </p> <p> <strong>Visit Timing:</strong> Shinzo visits Willowshore no more often than four times per month. He conveniently tends to show up right before or after the PCs level up, and before or after they set out on or return from a large expedition. His visits should generally be spaced out by at least 1 week. Try to time his arrival for when the PCs are close to leveling up, or when the PCs reach the halfway point of a level. </p> <p> <strong>Length of Stay:</strong> Shinzo stays in Willowshore for 24 hours each time he visits. </p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>@UUID[Actor.UiANTaOActIpURoo]{Asahina Shinzo}</span> <span>Creature 17</span> </h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>@UUID[Actor.l8v4Q00NwxgK1hTk]{Yix}</span> <span>Creature 1</span> </h2> </section>"

Unlike the mirage mist, though, this fog quickly grows unexpectedly and almost supernaturally thick, reducing visibility to a dozen feet or so.

Let the PCs attempt whatever check they wish, but regardless of the result, let them know that whatever is causing it is beyond their current knowledge, other than to suggest the possibility that some strange curse has settled down on the land—no doubt something tied to the invasion of monsters and the vanishing of Governor Heh and his estate. As the PCs won’t be able to reach Karahai, they should return to Willowshore to report their findings.

Alternatively, they could try to convince Wu-Xiu that supporting the town’s guards is a good idea. </p> <p> <strong>Challenge</strong> Whether the PCs decide to speak to Zheng Peng or Yong Wu-Xiu, it won’t be a simple and quick discussion to sway one or the other. To convince one of the two to capitulate to the other’s needs, the PCs must accumulate Victory Points by spending several 2-hour discussions with the NPC of their choice. They can either Intimidate Yong Wu-Xiu with stories of the dangers facing Willowshore (or even threaten her into complying with Zheng Peng’s requests) with @Check[intimidation|dc:21] checks or appeal to Zheng Peng’s sense of community (and perhaps promise to serve a more active role in helping to defend Willowshore themselves) with @Check[diplomacy|dc:18] checks. </p> <p> <strong>Reward</strong> Reaching 6 Victory Points is enough to convince the NPC to acquiesce to the solution favored by the PCs. This earns them 20 XP and 1 Reputation Point with either Southbank (if they sided with Yong Wu-Xiu) or Northridge (if they sided with Zheng Peng). </p> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2>Collecting Peachwood</h2> <p>Trigger The adventure has entered its second month.</p> <p> <strong>Requester</strong> Yun Mong-un (Woodcarver’s Guild, area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06mercantilest00]{W17}) </p> <p> <strong>Task</strong> Now that Willowshore needs to be more self-sufficient and to protect itself from “ghosts and monsters,” Mong-un asks the PCs to gather supplies of peachwood from the wilds. With fresh peachwood, Mong-un can craft paper suitable for the creation of several rare fulus that will help protect both Willowshore and the PCs from supernatural influences. </p> <p> <strong>Challenge</strong> Traditionally, supplies for making peachwood paper are imported since there’s a strong local belief that the three regional groves help to protect Willowshore from the influence of evil spirits, but with supply lines cut off, the PCs must visit these three groves to secure supplies for Mong-un. She can indicate to the PCs where the three local groves are located (they’re indicated with a “P” on the Willowshore Hinterlands map). Only the highest-quality, most flexible branches from a peachwood are suitable for crafting the paper required to create these fulus. To harvest supplies, a PC must attempt to Earn Income in the area to determine the value of raw materials gathered. A PC must attempt a @Check[nature|dc:18|traits:downtime,action:earn-income|name:Earn Income] or @Check[survival|dc:18|traits:downtime,action:earn-income|name:Earn Income] check to Earn Income, and it can be up to a 4th-level <strong>Task</strong> (with a DC set by level, according to table 10–5 on page 503 of the Core Rulebook). On a critical failure, no further attempts to harvest supplies from this grove can be attempted until next year (which, unknown to the PCs at this time, renders this grove useless for the remainder of the campaign). </p> <p> <strong>Reward</strong> The PCs can continue to harvest peachwood as long as the groves hold out. The first time they manage to harvest and hand over a total of 10 gp in supplies, grant them 20 XP and 1 Reputation Point with Northridge. In thanks for this support, Yun Mong-un offers to teach the PCs the formula for any of the rare fulus presented on page 83 and also gives each PC 8 gp worth of these fulus as thanks. Unfortunately, their harvesting of the peachwood trees bothers enough tradition-focused locals that the PCs also lose 1 Reputation Point with Southbank at this time. </p> </section> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 xiyangluo.webp\" alt=\"A dark haired woman in a purple kimono holding a paint brush\" title=\"Luo Xi Yang\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 xiyangluo.webp')\" /> <section class=\"action\"> <h2>The Teahouse Owner’s Will</h2> <p> Trigger The PCs discover “The Last Will and Testament of Qing Mai-Lai” in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19603reclai.JournalEntryPage.03publicfloor000]{C1} of the Cerulean Teahouse, or the third month of summer begins. </p> <p> <strong>Requester</strong> Luo Xi Yang (Luo &amp; Laws, area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19606willow.JournalEntryPage.06luoandlaws0000]{W16}) </p> <p> <strong>Task</strong> If the PCs discover this document on their own, they can begin its <strong>Challenge</strong> as soon as they read it and understand the requirement.

In order to comply with the will’s unusual stipulation, the pearls must be retrieved from these pools.</p> <p> To retrieve a pearl, a PC must succeed at a @Check[athletics|dc:16] check to reach the pond (as detailed in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19604thewil.JournalEntryPage.04eyesoffumeiy00]{D9}) and must then spend time searching the waters for a single pearl.

A few days after the PCs return from their failed attempt to reach Karahai, they’re asked by both town elders—Granny Hu and Old Matsuki—to meet with them at the Lady of Souls, the local temple of Pharasma. </p> <p> Here, the two elders set aside their personal grievances to thank the PCs for the services they’ve provided to Willowshore so far—and to then request that they continue their work to determine what has caused the town to become cursed. While the monstrous invasion of Willowshore was certainly an aspect of this curse, it seems to have been largely solved by lighting the Eternal Lantern and as a result of the PCs’ actions. Yet, as the elders point out, there are three other mysteries facing the town: the vanishing of Governor Heh and his estate, the strange mists that surround the hinterlands and prevent travel, and the disappearance of the stone spider known as Ugly Cute. </p> <p> The elders ask the PCs to investigate all three of these developments—the order in which they’re tackled is irrelevant, although the disappearance of the governor seems to be the most pressing matter.

Neither elder knows anyone in town who has the right combination of power and motivation to pull something like this off, but then they recall an event that happened near the end of the previous year, when Governor Heh had some fugitives arrested. </p> <aside class=\"sidebar\"> <h1>How it Feels to Lose It all</h1> <p> This event took place three years ago, in the winter of 7105. Governor Heh received a missive from Sze to be on the lookout for “dangerous fugitives” said to have attempted to curse the imperial family. When one of these fugitives, a singer named Fan Hongrui, showed up in Willowshore claiming to be searching for aid in dealing with a friend’s snakebite, the governor attempted to arrest her. </p> <p> Fan Hongrui used magic to distract and injure his guards and then fled. As soon as the guards recovered, the governor led them in pursuit of the woman. They tracked her to Canary Inn, a roadside shelter to the northeast of Willowshore, but in the tense standoff that followed a fire erupted. Officially, the fire is believed to have been triggered by the fugitive, but there are more than a few who claim the governor and his guards started the blaze in an attempt to force the fugitive and her allies out into the open. </p> <p> What none contest is that the final words Hongrui sung out as the building burned seemed to unsettle Governor Heh, for she promised that “All those who serve Lung Wa will soon known how it feels to lose it all!” </p> <p> At the time, it seemed little more than the dying oath of a criminal, but in hindsight, with Lung Wa collapsing within a year, the PCs’ patron wonders if there was more magic to the oath than they suspected. In any case, the bodies of Fan Hongrui’s two accomplices were recovered and buried near the ruined building, but her remains were never found. </p> </aside> <p> While the elders admit the connection to Governor Heh’s disappearance three years later seems tenuous, it’s the closest thing they’ve come up with to explain what could have happened. They ask the PCs to travel to Canary Inn to investigate the site, if only to confirm this strange story is merely a coincidence to the governor’s disappearance. </p>"

If any of the PCs carry a musical instrument or are otherwise obviously a performer, she points to that character and asks in a forlorn voice, “Are you here to entertain us?

She allows each PC to ask her one question that she’ll answer to the best of her ability. </p> <p> <strong>Success</strong> Hongrui’s anger is soothed somewhat. She doesn’t lower her illusion but still asks the PCs why they’ve come to visit her.

If the PCs don’t comply immediately, the thatchlings attack. </p> <p> <strong>Critical Failure</strong> The thatchlings begin giggling in mockery well before the performance ends and attack at once. </p> <p> If Hongrui is soothed enough that she allows the PCs to ask questions, feel free to answer what the PCs ask as you see fit, to the best of her ability. She knows nothing about the mindscape surrounding Willowshore, but if asked about the governor, her expression darkens and she says he was a lapdog of Lung Wa and an enemy to the individual. She has no idea that Lung Wa has collapsed, or that Governor Heh has vanished, but if she learns that he has gone missing, she says, “Those in power will always abuse or abandon their responsibility, given time—be grateful your governor chose to leave you rather than inflict upon your town something worse.” </p> <p> Once she has answered their questions, if a PC achieved a critical success on the Performance check, she sighs in relief—she and the other thatchlings fade away, their reed bodies collapsing to the ground. If the Willowshore mindscape is allowed to eventually reset, the three will return next year, but until then, these three thatchlings won’t rejuvenate.

A PC who Searches in this area and succeeds at a @Check[perception|dc:16] check notices irregularities in the charred soil that they recognize as shallow graves. </p> <p> If the PCs exhume the bodies, they’ll find two skeletons—all that remains of Hongxin and Hongban. If the PCs see that these two bodies are given proper burials, the three thatchlings don’t rejuvenate again during this mindscape cycle. </p> <p> Curiously, a red cloak that once belonged to Hongrui lies in the graves as well. If the PCs see to it that the bodies receive proper burials, one PC (the one who attempted the Performance check, preferably) feels a sudden sense of gratitude and understands that Hongrui wants them to take her cloak as thanks for the kindness. Likewise, if a PC critically succeeded at the Performance check, when the thatchlings fade, that PC feels the urge to exhume the grave and claim the cloak as a reward. </p> <p> If Hongrui offers the cloak to the PCs as thanks, it functions as a unique magic item called Hongrui’s Gratitude. If the PCs claim the cloak without her gratitude, it instead functions as a stone of weight (Gamemastery Guide 92), suddenly increasing to 5 Bulk if worn for longer than 1 minute. This curse can be lifted normally but also fades as soon as the two skeletons are given a proper, respectful burial, whereupon the cloak becomes Hongrui’s Gratitude. </p> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs bring rest to the three thatchlings, grant them 40 XP in addition to what they would’ve earned for defeating them in combat. Thatchlings are no longer encountered in the Willowshore mindscape, and any random encounter resulting in a thatchling is treated as no encounter. Additionally, the region feels slightly less haunted overall. This improves the townsfolk’s morale and the PCs gain 1 Reputation Point with Northridge and Southbank. </p> <p> While this line of investigation ends at a dead end for the PCs, the town elder encourages them to pursue the other two leads and hopes that they might ultimately help solve the mystery of the vanished governor. </p>"

The town is relatively self-sufficient, but without trade, the coming winter will be difficult. While the new reality of this mysterious mist settles in on the town, its people will need heroes to look up to—a role the PCs are primed to fill in the coming months. For now, the town elders have a very specific request for the PCs: they’d like to determine the extent of the effect that surrounds Willowshore. Do these strange mists merely prevent travel to the coast and to Karahai? Or do they completely encircle the region—and if so, to what extent? </p> <p> While simply exploring the limits of the “curse” and following the mist in a circuit around the region is one way to determine its reach, this would be a long, potentially dangerous slog through trackless wilderness. Instead, the town elder favored by the PCs suggests they pay a visit to the Great Willow that stands on the hilltop just north of town. There dwells a local spirit whose connection to the hinterland wilderness should allow them to provide valuable insight into what’s going on. </p> <aside class=\"sidebar\"> <h1>Following the Border</h1> <p> The mindscape’s misty border doesn’t manifest until one physically crosses it, at which point the traveler spends a few moments confused and disoriented, only to step back into the mindscape at the point they crossed the border in the first place. Since there’s no visual cue to follow without repeating this process, mapping out the mindscape’s borders by exploring is repetitive and complicated. Once a PC reaches a hex through which the border runs, they can map out the border’s path through that hex by spending 4 hours Searching that hex through a process of exhaustive exploration and backtracking to interact with the border over and over. A PC can thus map out the border of two adjacent hexes in a day’s work before becoming fatigued. </p> <p> Note that the Wall of Ghosts, which serves as an additional border along the mindscape’s western side, is very much a physical and visual barrier—see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19604thewil.JournalEntryPage.04wallofghosts00]{Wall of Ghosts} for more information about this feature and how the PCs can interact with it. </p> </aside>"

Said to be the first place Master Zhi Hui visited on her search for the Tan Sugi, the tree has endured through the years as one of the town’s symbols, yet no road or trail has ever been laid to the hill’s summit. Everyone knows that a spirit dwells within the tree, a kami who calls themself Great Willow and who watches over the town, yet few feel it’s wise to disturb or potentially annoy the spirit. As such, visits to Great Willow tend to happen rarely, and only at times when Willowshore needs advice from the spirit world—times such as those now facing the settlement. </p> <p> In addition to seeking wisdom from Great Willow, the elders suggest to the PCs that they organize an offering from the townsfolk to bring to the tree, in hopes of currying the spirit’s favor in protecting Willowshore. At the very least, bringing an offering should help make conversing with the spirit easier. The elders suggest an offering of wine or sake, as can any PC who succeeds at a @Check[nature|dc:16|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] or @Check[willowshore-lore|dc:14|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge. A PC who critically succeeds at this check realizes an even better offering would be a custom-made, hand-crafted twisted rope—a shimenawa—that the kodama could use to drape over the tree’s branches or to use to aid in their own creation of spiritual ropes. </p> <p> Wine or sake can be purchased anywhere in town, but if the PCs decide to offer a shimenawa, it’s best for one of them to craft the braided rope themselves, as the kodama will likely be insulted if such a gift is delivered by hands that didn’t craft it. The shimenawa need not be particularly long—a PC can craft an appropriate offering with an expenditure of 3 gp on materials and a successful @Check[crafting|dc:16] check as a 1-hour activity (a critical failure indicates the materials are ruined and can’t be reused on another attempt). </p> <p> It’s about a 1-mile walk through relatively light forest to reach the Great Willow, but since the terrain involves navigating a steep slope at times, this trip is considered difficult terrain. A party that moves at a speed of 25 feet can make the trip from Willowshore to the Great Willow in about 20 minutes. As the PCs approach the hilltop, the forest thins into a clearing. </p> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> The forest thins around the hilltop, leaving an eighty-foot-diameter clearing at its summit. Atop the hill in the center of the clearing grows the Great Willow—the only willow tree present in much of the forest. Looming at a height of nearly ninety feet, the Great Willow is also quite large for its kind. Yet the reason the Great Willow has held such a place of reverence in Willowshore’s history has more to do with the spirit said to dwell within it. At least a few years have passed since anyone has visited the Great Willow, but even from the clearing’s edge, it’s apparent that something seems amiss with the tree, for some sort of gray fungal growth has seemingly infested its lower roots. </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 great willow.webp\" alt=\"A creature that looks like a stack of rocks\" title=\"The Great Willow\" style=\"z-index:5;shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 great willow.webp')\" /> <p> <strong>Creatures:</strong> As the PCs enter the clearing, Great Willow emerges from the tree to adopt a defensive pose among its roots, little fists upraised. They call out a challenge to the PCs, demanding they explain why they dare approach. Note that PCs who come within 30 feet of the tree and its kodama will be in range of Great Willow’s Distracting Gaze. </p> <p> When the PCs explain themselves, allow them a chance to attempt a @Check[diplomacy|dc:24|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression] check to Make an Impression on Great Willow, whose starting attitude is unfriendly. If the PCs reveal that they have an offering for Great Willow, the DC drops by 10 to @Check[diplomacy|dc:14|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression]. If the offering the PCs bring is a hand-made shimenawa, then they also increase result of their check by one degree of success. </p> <p> If Great Willow remains unfriendly, they demand the PCs leave at once and “come back tomorrow”; if the PCs do so, they’ll need to bring a brand new offering. Each time they return, the DC to Make an Impression is reduced by 2. </p> <p> If Great Willow becomes hostile, they shriek in rage, accuse the PCs of being “the source of the curse,” and attack. Great Willow doesn’t aim to kill PCs as much as to frighten them away and breaks off from combat if the PCs call for a truce. They won’t pursue the PCs beyond the edge of the clearing, and they retreat to the tree to merge with it if reduced to fewer than 30 Hit Points. If the PCs flee and then return at a later date, the DC to Make an Impression on Great Willow increases by 2. </p> <p> If Great Willow is made indifferent or friendly, they calm down and agree to speak to the PCs, as detailed below under Talking with Great Willow. </p> <p> Great Willow can’t be made friendly until the PCs solve the fungus infestation situation down south (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19604thewil.JournalEntryPage.04intotheinfes00]{Into the Infestation}). </p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span>@UUID[Actor.pNScPEXM1XAvTmgM]{Great Willow}</span><span>Creature 5</span></h2> </section> <p> <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.VyhAPt8k9wTeYooB]{Willow's Parting Gift}<br /> If the PCs made Great Willow friendly, once they prepare to leave, the grateful kodama gives them a parting gift—a lesser rope of climbing (Advanced Player’s Guide 262) made of supernaturally supple woven willow branches. </p> <aside class=\"sidebar\"> <h1>The Last Kodama</h1> <p> What Great Willow doesn’t yet realize, but will soon enough (as they’ve done so in every mindscape cycle before), is that they’re the only kodama present in the region now.

I am fighting it back, but I fear for my friend.” </p> <p> If the PCs ask about the strange misty border that they faced when they attempted to reach Karahai, Great Willow nods slowly in understanding, replying as follows. </p> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> “Yes. I sense it too. It is a curse. A powerful one. I can feel its edges all around. We are in a cage now. When it happened on the first day of summer, I was confused. I was alone. I could not hear my friends’ voices. I jumped to visit my closest friend and they were not there, but a foul-tempered mushroom was, and I had to run away all the way back to here. Alone. I don’t know what to do. I dare not leave this tree again when this curse is all around, but I can look for its edges from here. I will tell you more, but before I do, I need to know my friend is safe. You will go to save her from the angry mushroom, and then I will help.” </p> <p> Every first day of summer, when the mindscape’s yearly cycle resets, Great Willow senses the change to the environment but is, each time, at a loss as to its cause. And every year, they use tree stride to travel from their willow tree ward to a willow grove nearly 5 miles to the south of Willowshore to check up on the kami of a grove of willow trees located there—a kami who, unlike Great Willow, wasn’t pulled into the mindscape. This year, things have changed for the worse: Kugaptee’s influence allowed an infestation of hostile fungi to bloom in this grove. </p> <p> When Great Willow used tree stride to travel to the grove, they found the place overgrown with fungi, with no sign of the kodama who once dwelled there (these kodama avoided being drawn into the mindscape—see The @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19604thewil.JournalEntryPage.04visitinggrea00#the-last-kodama]{The Last Kodama} sidebar). Faced with aggression from a hostile fungus and having used their only casting of tree stride for the day, Great Willow was forced to make the undignified trek back home to their ward atop this hill on foot—and in so doing, tracked invasive fungal spores with them. </p> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> If a PC succeeds at a @Check[nature|dc:18|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge, they can share some helpful techniques with Great Willow on how to fight back against the fungal infestation.

Once a place where locals came to enjoy nature and pursue romance, Kugaptee’s influence clung to those positive emotions like a parasite, resulting in an influx of dangerous fungi. The fungi mostly manifested as slime molds that immediately slithered out into the surrounding hinterlands (and that can now be periodically encountered as wandering monsters), but one, a myceloid named Xungu, remains here. </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 xungu.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Xungu\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/art/pzo90196 xungu.webp')\" /> <p> Xungu is a direct physical result of Kugaptee’s influence, and while they have memories of “ruling” this grove for decades, they didn’t exist before this mindscape cycle began. The myceloid spends most of their time patrolling the perimeter of the infested patch, looking for meat to catch to prepare for meals. Faced with the PCs, Xungu is initially more duplicitous than violent. As a manifestation from Kugaptee’s thoughts, Xungu speaks Common rather than Undercommon, but this doesn’t stop them, upon spotting the PCs, from recounting a pitiful tale of how they were chased out from their underground colony. The myceloid explains how the kodama who dwelled here welcomed Xungu into their home, but then they all vanished, and now Xungu is all alone again. Xungu then asks one of the PCs to stay overnight and share a meal so that they won’t feel lonely. The myceloid explains they have “secrets” to share but are bashful about sharing with too many people at once. </p> <p> All of these claims are falsehoods, of course, and fortunately for the PCs, Xungu isn’t a particularly skilled liar. If the party agrees to this request, once Xungu and the PC are alone, they reveal to the PC that the secret is that they’re really hungry and that the meal they’ll “share” will be Xungu eating the PC—the myceloid attacks at once, hoping to overpower the lone PC. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-the-summer-that-never-was/assets/tokens/PZO90196%20xungu.webp\" /> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Into the Infestation</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Moderate 2</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.ZjQpltolVIkW5i2y]{Xungu}</span> </div> <p> When Xungu tells this story, they attempt a +0 Deception check to Lie, but even if this story is successful against every PC’s Perception DC, the players should still make their own decisions as to what to do. Called out as a liar, Xungu huffs in frustration, then says, “Well, I suppose I’ll have to settle for a banquet instead of a snack!” and attacks, intending to capture and eat the entire party. When Xungu attacks, they try to capture PCs, hoping to draw things out long enough for PCs to perish from purple pox, since poxy meat is tastier. This should give the party time to rescue a captured PC or (if the whole party gets caught) for NPCs to come rescue them instead. Xungu fights to the death, in any event, and pursues fleeing PCs for only a few rounds before returning to the infested grove. </p> </section> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> With Xungu’s death, the fungus infestation in the grove immediately begins to recede, with mushrooms and mold shrinking, melting, and evaporating. After just an hour, the grove is restored fully.

They can sense no other kodama in the vicinity, and by the time the PCs return from defeating Xungu, Great Willow has already started to meditate upon the curse’s boundaries. They can give the PCs a rough estimate of the size of the region they’re trapped in, describing it as a region about 10 to 16 miles or so in every direction from Willowshore. More importantly, Great Willow mentions that something even more potent seems to lie to the west—the kodama is sensing the Wall of Ghosts, but isn’t sure what it might be. While none of Great Willow’s revelations will help the PCs defeat the “curse” that affects them, it should give them an idea of the scope of the region they’re trapped in.

The Prayers have been sacrificing captives in hopes of opening the Wall of Ghosts and revealing the “paradise” they believe waits for them beyond. The Rovers, meanwhile, want to cause pain and suffering in the region, believing that doing so will make the wall expand and bring paradise to them.

In the center of the irregular configuration of lights hunkers a misshapen effigy crafted from a very deformed burl.</p> <p>The candle flames here are an eerie magical effect sustained by Kugaptee’s influence—the flames don’t melt the candles or give off smoke. The effigy strangely seems to shimmer and ripple when studied, as if it were trying to hide its actual form from observation. One moment it appears as a hunched-over man with long broken arms and a head made of a bundle of twigs. In another, it shifts to a crouching frog choking on a man it swallowed whole. In the next, it appears to take on a form not wholly spider nor octopus nor plant, yet something combining all three. Then, as soon as one sees a shape, it shifts back to a tangled knot of roots, branches, and bark. This strange sight is a manifestation of Kugaptee himself, one that provides vague hints to his true nature without revealing any actual truth. If the candles are extinguished, the effigy loses these traits and appears simply as a human-sized burl of tangled wood.</p> <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> A pair of noppera-bo occultists sit before the effigy, faceless and repeatedly genuflecting as they worship the image, chanting telepathic prayers the PCs can hear in their minds as the name “Kugaptee” over and over.

They only attack if the PCs lay hands on one of them, damage or extinguish the candles, or attempt to touch or damage the effigy. </p> <p>If questioned, the two noppera-bos patiently answer the PCs’ queries. These noppera-bos belong to the Prayers faction, though they don’t identify themselves by that name. Rather, they call themselves the Teeth of Kugaptee, and explain that Kugaptee promises freedom from the cycle of suffering that is the River of Souls. The occultists praise their leader, Zoudou, as a visionary and meticulous servant who can narrow down the perfect second for a sacrifice. The two noppera-bos spit at the mention of Mugirou, calling him ungrateful and irresponsible for putting his own wants before Kugaptee’s needs. Asked for more information about Kugaptee himself, the occultists speak in metaphors and even at times seem to contradict each other, with one comparing him to the “first breath you take when you are born” to the other describing him as “the first breath you’ll never take after you die.”</p> <p>If the PCs declare they’re here to rescue the kidnapped NPCs, these occultists find this goal quite understandable, noting that “if it is to be that they should not be sent to Kugaptee, who are we to deny their fate?” They propose a bargain: if the PCs can humiliate or defeat Mugirou in combat, these two are willing to escort the PCs to Zoudou and ask her to spare those who are to be sacrificed, for a price.

A pair of noppera-bo occultists stand on the ground to the east and south, about 5 feet from the shrine’s lowest step, performing duties as secondary casters. Meanwhile, Zoudou leads the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dbd5W6G8U2vzWolN]{Consecrate}</em> ritual she hopes will attract Kugaptee’s attention, secure his blessing over the area, and potentially even result in him sending agents from beyond to bolster the Prayers’ strength.</p> <p>Zoudou arrogantly doesn’t expect interruptions to the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dbd5W6G8U2vzWolN]{Consecrate}</em> ritual she’s in the middle of performing, so she and the other occultists (who are serving as secondary casters for the ritual) take a –4 circumstance penalty to Perception checks until the PCs become impossible to ignore—this includes initiative checks. Meng-sung wears only a loincloth and is tightly bound (Escape <strong>DC 25</strong>); while he’s otherwise unharmed, he won’t try to get free as long as a creepy, faceless monster armed with a dagger looms over him.</p> <p>As <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dbd5W6G8U2vzWolN]{Consecrate}</em> takes 3 days to cast, the PCs certainly have time to interrupt the ritual before it ends with Meng-sung’s sacrifice.

Unfortunately for the PCs, Zoudou isn’t interested in halting her ritual, and if the PCs truly wish to save Meng-sung, Zoudou agrees only at a steep price: one of the PCs must offer themself in Meng-sung’s place. If the PCs agree, Zoudou replies as follows.</p> <div class=\"read-aloud\"> <p>“It is quite simple, for Kugaptee is generous and accepting. Come before his Wall, Child of the Ensnared. I will show you how to free yourself from the bondage of the world. Repeat my words:</p> <p>“I offer thee my name, Great Kugaptee! Unbind me from those whom I called friends.</p> <p>“I offer thee my blood, Great Kugaptee! Unbind me from those whom I called family.</p> <p>“I offer thee my flesh, Great Kugaptee! Unbind me from the body I called my own.</p> <p>“Lastly, I offer thee my soul, Great Kugaptee! Unbind me from that which was my fate.”</p> </div> <p>Most PCs will likely balk at this prayer, and rightfully so, for the next stage involves that PC taking Meng-sung’s place on the altar. Rather than ending in the sacrifice of the PC’s life, the consecrate ritual ends with Zoudou passing her dagger over the PC’s body and “cutting” their soul’s link to the cycle of life and death. Promising a soul in this way counts as an act of anathema for all religions other than the worship of Kugaptee and could have repercussions on champion or cleric characters, but it has no other immediate effect on the PC—until they die. At this point, the PC’s soul is absorbed into Kugaptee’s domain, preventing that PC from being resurrected or otherwise restored to life. At your discretion, the soul of such a slain PC could potentially be encountered or rescued in the final part of the last adventure of Season of Ghosts. A successful atone ritual can also break this link to Kugaptee and prevent this unpleasant fate.</p> <p>If the PCs refuse the exchange, Zoudou sneers and observes that she isn’t surprised at the PCs’ lack of conviction and their spiritual cowardice. If the PCs don’t attack, Zoudou returns to the consecrate ritual. If the PCs allow the ritual to play out to its end, Meng-sung is sacrificed.

Any surviving noppera-bos collapse to their knees in fear and begin to telepathically beg for mercy as a vast, vaguely humanoid shadow rears up beyond the Wall of Ghosts. The shadow lunges at the wall from the far side, causing the misty barrier to suddenly flex and bulge as if it were a solid wall being pushed against from beyond. The shadow vanishes and leaves the Wall of Ghosts intact, but the bodies of the three noppera-bos, be they living or dead, suddenly burst apart as immense mockeries of their previous forms climb out of their bodies, shedding the smaller frames to emerge as misshapen undead versions of themselves. Their arms hang low, nearly to their ankles, and appear to be broken in several places; instead of heads, they have moldy wicker cages filled with blood-colored butterflies.

After Tan Sui-Jing’s triumphant act of self-sacrifice defeated the fiend Kugaptee in 6223 ic, there rose a challenge among Sangpotshi practitioners to locate the sugi tree Sui-Jing transformed into. In 7020, a Sangpotshi master under the Fluvial name of Master Zhi Hui accomplished this feat. To ensure that others could safely visit the tree’s grove themselves, Master Zhi Hui decided to enshrine the sugi within the Tan Sugi monastery, where Sangpotshi practitioners could come to reflect upon the philosophy.</p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform:scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-199-season-of-ghosts/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital\" /> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Scene Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Ambiance</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Playlist.YMBqSrJs9w6YzO97.PlaylistSound.pQRXBlMVo0w3NRk0]{Willowshore}</span> </div> </section> <p>The wooded and mountainous terrain made construction immensely difficult, even for the most seasoned of builders. Some refused to rest there, as the idea of sleeping near a place where another died (even for a noble cause) was taboo. Master Zhi Hui gladly accommodated these workers and sought funds to build them living quarters and other facilities at the foot of the mountain where supplies were dropped off at a convenient harbor along the riverside. The merchants ferrying in the supplies took to calling the remote settlement “the shore of willows,” a local metaphor meaning “impossible to find.” In time, the name became associated with the settlement, shortened to Willowshore.</p> <p>After five years of hard work on the monastery, the workers turned their focus to expanding Willowshore, building inns, farmhouses, and other structures to support a growing stream of long-term visitors. At the height of the monastery’s popularity, almost every shop or farm offered a meal and bed for pilgrims. This economic boom faded with Master Zhi Hui’s death in 7054, and many Willowshore residents began to ply their skills and wares further afield to earn a living as the Tan Sugi monastery began its slow decline.</p> <p>In 7060, Shenmen enlisted the village to become part of Lung Wa’s lumber harvesting ambitions. Things started out well, with the construction of infrastructure including bridges and a dam. However, the lumber bosses who ran the harvesting operation soon became loathed for their exploitation of Willowshore’s ascetic past. Worse, they began to present the settlement (now properly called a town) as a “getaway” for Lung Wa aristocrats to hunt for sport and indulge in food and drinks forcefully seized in the empire’s name.</p> <p>The lumber bosses and government cared little for the long-abandoned monastery until their greedy expansion reached for the Tan Sugi grove in 7062 and an attempt to harvest the sacred trees ended in grisly slaughter. The sole survivor’s testimony cemented an ill reputation within Willowshore of the abandoned monastery. As monster sightings grew in the weeks and months after, the appointed governor responded by enticing imperial forces to move into the town with the promise of land or property in compensation for the protection they could offer. Many of these soldiers would ultimately retire in the region, becoming a new wave of settlers in the town.</p> <p>When Lung Wa collapsed in 7106, Willowshore’s lumber lords took their wealth, abandoned their estates, and fled. Most soldiers returned to Shenmen’s capital or deserted their posts, leaving behind those who had put down local roots. Though Willowshore’s remoteness saved it from the rampant banditry and external political conflicts, the isolation also delayed major news. Willowshore didn’t learn of the jorogumo takeover of all Shenmen until late spring of 7108, news that compelled the town’s governor Heh Shan-Bao to attempt a dangerous ritual to restore the protective power of the Tan Sugi monastery. The ritual backfired and instead awakened the fiend Kugaptee’s legacy, resulting in a devastating wave of power that tragically killed the entire town. </p> <p>The sun rose the next day on a Willowshore devoid of life, and to the world at large, the town has remained an abandoned source of ghost stories for over a hundred years. However, those who perished in this event never realized their fate, for their slain souls became trapped an alternate reality. Stuck in a strange limbo between life and death, they reside in a mindscape largely indistinguishable from reality to those who live within its realm.</p>"

Inevitably, the supernatural borders that surround the region are discovered, forcing the citizens of Willowshore to come to terms with their new unnatural situation, but every year on the last day of spring, time resets and all memory and progress toward understanding the nature of the mindscape resets, starting the cycle over again.

The mindscape’s inhabitants, including the PCs, remain unaware of their reality until later in the Adventure Path.</p> <p class=\"no-indent\">Willowshore’s mindscape has the cyclic time trait and is locked into a “time loop.” The mindscape has a set point in time when it starts and when it ends after the passage of a year. When time reaches this yearly end point, everything within the mindscape (including all natives of the mindscape) revert in time. All developments, accomplishments, and memories of the previous year are lost, and everything resets to the state things were at the start. This restores all native creatures to their previous age, resets their health and location to where they were at the start, and even resurrects those who died during the past year. The soul of a cyclic mindscape native who dies doesn’t enter the River of Souls but instead remains in stasis awaiting the end of the mindscape’s current cycle. In some cases, eerie echoes of previous cycles can accumulate in strange and unique ways, resulting in haunt-like manifestations or undead creatures, such as @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19607advent.JournalEntryPage.07thatchling0000]{Thatchlings}.</p> <p class=\"no-indent\">During each cycle, events proceed identically unless an outside influence (such as a visiting creature from another reality) disrupts these events, potentially setting up a significantly different scenario for the rest of that cycle’s remaining time. When a cyclic mindscape resets, foreign objects or visitors remain, along with their memories of previous cycles, and they can use these memories to their advantage as they see fit. Such events have never happened in Willowshore’s mindscape before, but this time, things will be different.</p> </section> <aside class=\"sidebar\"><h2>Mindscape Inhabitants</h2> <p>Four types of inhabitants dwell in Willowshore.</p> <p><strong>Trapped Souls:</strong> The citizens of Willowshore (including the PCs), as well as most of the sapient creatures in the hinterlands perished in 7108 and then became trapped, alive and with no memories of their deaths, in the mindscape.</p> <p><strong>Non-Sapient Creatures:</strong> Creatures like animal companions or familiars are linked spiritually to PCs and are considered to be trapped souls, but the rest of the non-sapient wildlife and plant life that dwells in the mindscape function as normal animals of their kind but lack anything akin to a soul—when they’re slain, they decay as normal but can’t become undead, nor can they be restored to life.</p> <p><strong>Monstrous Manifestations:</strong> The influence of the fiend Kugaptee introduces physical and free-willed manifestations of monsters whose appearance at the end of the mindscape’s previous cycle have persisted into this one. They have no true memories of their existence before the mindscape’s formation, nor do they possess a soul, but they otherwise function as typical monsters of their kind. They can’t be brought back to life or become undead, but their bodies remain after death and decay as normal.</p> <p><strong>Visitors:</strong> A very few inhabitants of the mindscape are visitors from beyond its border. The shinigami merchant named Shinzo is one example here, as are nindoru fiends the PCs will encounter starting in the second adventure.</p> </aside>"

Current trending topics are the recent exodus of the lumber lords, news of the jorogumo seizing control of the nation, and preparations for the upcoming season of ghosts.</p> <p>Many Willowshorers identify by when their family first settled in town, which often affects which bank of the Ceiba River they live on. The first wave of townspeople are either those who worked on the monastery or who were paid to settle in Willowshore by the monastery. These folks originally lived south of the river and are thus referred to as Southbankers. Those who arrived after Lung Wa took control, meanwhile, settled on the river’s northern banks, called Northridge due to its prominent incline. These settlers included workers for the lumber bosses, businesses that wanted convenient access to the lumber, and imperial guards.</p> <p>Though these two factions in Willowshore today use the names Southbank and Northridge, one’s allegiance isn’t solely determined by where they live or work. Southbank folks are traditionalists, keen on maintaining Willowshore’s culture and living simply off the land. Northridge folks, meanwhile, focus on modern pragmatism and urban growth. Many Northridge folks are open to the idea of the jorogumos ruling Shenmen, while Southbankers on principle think the jorogumos are evil monsters and best avoided.</p> <p>Despite disagreements, both sides have a consensus on putting Willowshore’s survival and safety first. Plenty of residents have their own opinions that lean in neither direction and consider themselves unaffiliated with either faction. Overall, Willowshore values giving all one has to offer.
